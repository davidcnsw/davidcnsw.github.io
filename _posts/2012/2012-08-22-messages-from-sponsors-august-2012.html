<p>Every so often I ask my site sponsors to send me a few paragraphs of a message they want to broadcast to readers. This message from the sponsors post contains a ton of information about a variety of products, programs, new releases, upcoming webinars, conferences, recorded presentations, tools, and other information for the technical communication community.</p>
<h2>From Southern Polytechnic State University</h2>
<p>(message from Laura Palmer and Carol Barnum)</p>
<p><strong>Where will Tech Com be in 5 Years? And where will you be?</strong></p>
<p>We know that some of you would rather be writing, or you wouldn't be following Tom's blog.</p>
<p>But we see the future of Tech Com as much more than writing.  And we've reshaped our grad programs to address the future now.</p>
<p>This past year we've been engaged in lively and thought-provoking discussions about our <a title="Information Design &amp; Communication -- Southern Polytechnic State University" href="http://www.spsu.edu/etcma/grad/idc_overview.htm">Information Design &amp; Communication graduate program here at Southern Polytechnic</a>. From our ongoing exchanges, we've been considering what <strong><em>you</em></strong>, as a potential applicant to our M.S. degree or grad certificates, need when it comes to making an investment in <strong><em>your future</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>What You'll Want</strong></p>
<p>You'll want a graduate education that looks beyond today—that's a given. The profession is in a period of flux and careers are already changing in ways no one expected. Tomorrow's careers in information design and communication will require individuals with critical and strategic communication competencies, research skills, and a grounding in the principles of effective design and user experience. These same individuals will also need a broad business perspective and the ability to make decisions based on both theory and practice.</p>
<p>We've assessed what you'll need in these areas to take your tech com career in new and dynamic directions. As a result, we've repositioned our program to support the goals of tech communicators who want to think and act strategically, to communicate a vision of the future, to embrace change, and to collaborate with strategic partners at all levels of an organization.</p>
<p><strong>Meeting Your Needs</strong></p>
<p>To prepare you to take your career to the next level, we took a long, hard look at what defines this level, and we know it's <strong><em>leadership</em></strong> abilities. Courses in project management, business analysis, and user research, including mobile user experience, are now a vital part of our grad curriculum in Information Design &amp; Communication.</p>
<p>We've also reshaped our current courses to embrace what we see as a necessary <strong><em>strategic </em></strong>component. We see the graduates of our programs being well positioned to make communication decisions that have a measurable impact.</p>
<p>By no means are we abandoning the essential skills of writing and design; rather, we're supplementing them with competencies that can move your career from the cubicle to the C-level suite.</p>
<p>Our new focus conveys, we believe, what an individual with a graduate credential should want—a challenging career that melds management and business practices with strategic communication design. We've taken the vigor and call-to-action stance of MBA program language—strategy, acceleration, collaboration, innovation—and used it to define our position as a graduate program.</p>
<p><strong>New Ideas, New Offerings</strong></p>
<p>You'll see several essential changes to our MS degree in Information Design &amp; Communication.  In addition to new course offerings in Business Analysis, Content Strategy, and Information Architecture, we now require all M.S. students to take a research methods course and a project management course.</p>
<p>And in our graduate certificates, in addition to our Technical Communication certificate, we have refocused our advanced certificates and added a new one so that our lineup of advanced certificates now includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual Communication</li>
<li>Content Strategy</li>
<li>Instructional Design</li>
<li>Communication Management</li>
<li>User Experience (new!)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Technical Communication certificate offers students the opportunity to take graduate level coursework without taking the GRE, and then decide, on completion of six courses, if they want to apply to go on in the M.S. degree program.</p>
<p>The advanced certificates target those of you holding a graduate degree in technical communication (or related field) who are ready to get up to speed in a specialty area.</p>
<p>We're working on a redesign of our IDC website to reflect these changes.  So, if you're thinking of fine tuning your skills and staying ahead of the curve, check out <a title="Southern Polytechnic State University" href="http://www.spsu.edu/etcma/grad/">idc.spsu.edu</a>.  Then come back later this fall for the new website design.  The deadline for spring semester applications is November 1.</p>

<p><strong>Maintaining XSLT code as a structured FrameMaker document | Sept 5, 10:00-11:00 AM (Pacific Time)</strong></p>
<p>This webinar describes a structured FrameMaker application for editing XSLT. While the document window appears to show actual XSLT code, the structure of the edited document is an easily-understood variation of that used in the final XML output. Once a document is complete, the user saves it as XML using an application that uses XSLT itself to change from the editing structure into actual XSLT code. Furthermore, existing XSLT code can be brought into this environment by opening it using an application that converts XSLT to the editing structure.</p>

<p><strong>The Lean User Guide – Applying Lean Principles in User Assistance</strong></p>
<p><em>Recorded Aug 15, 10:00-11:00 am (Pacific)</em></p>
<p>If we want to move away from a hand-crafted approach to developing content and towards a more engineering-like approach, what can we learn from the latest techniques being applied in manufacturing? Today, many manufacturers use Lean manufacturing principles, and its principles underpin Agile programming. In this presentation we'll explore whether applying a Lean approach to technical publications could (a) lead to better deliverables and a more efficient system for producing User Assistance and (b) better position Technical Publications in the context of an Agile environment.</p>

<h2>Join Etteplan | Tedopres for a free webinar on controlled authoring</h2>
<p><strong>Simplified Technical English – how to save cost and achieve content quality for technical documentation</strong></p>

Time: 4 PM CEST / 9 AM EST<br />
Duration: 1 hour<br />
<a href="https://www3.gotomeeting.com/register/664759278">Register here</a></p>
<p>Simplified Technical English is a method of writing that makes technical English easy to understand. The adaptation of a controlled language stimulates the (global) acceptance of technical documentation as it improves readability and translatability, and prevents misunderstandings and misinterpretations.</p>
<p>Join Berry Braster from Etteplan | Tedopres for an interactive webinar. During this webinar, Berry will explain the benefits of controlled authoring using case studies, and show how overall cost, time to market, and content volume will be reduced and how you can save considerably on translations: up to 40% per language!</p>
<p>We will also review how a good STE software implementation can dramatically increase the benefits of working with Simplified Technical English (STE). We will demonstrate how HyperSTE offers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cost savings on translation and localization (up to 30%)</li>
<li>Quality assurance and quality measurement for content</li>
<li>Reduced time to market</li>
<li>More efficient authors and editors</li>
<li>Improved safety</li>
<li>Improved customer service</li>
