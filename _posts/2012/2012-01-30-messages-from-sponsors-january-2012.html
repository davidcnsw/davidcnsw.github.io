<p>Below are a few messages from my blog's sponsors. Check them out and see if any interest you. Many of them have upcoming webinars.</p>
<h2>News from Madcap</h2>
<p>MadCap Software is pleased to present free live webinars from industry experts covering a variety of topics essential for today's technical writers.  Sign up today to advance your professional skills and learn about the latest trends in technical communication.</p>
<p><strong>Moving from FrameMaker to Flare | Feb 7, 10:00-11:00 am (Pacific Time)</strong></p>
<p>Are you using FrameMaker as your primary authoring tool? While Frame is great for book publishing, it requires separate tools and plug-ins to single source content for the web. If you are tired of the expense and the headache of using multiple tools, consider switching to MadCap Flare.</p>
<p>Flare matches and exceeds FrameMaker's best features, including variables, snippets (equivalent to text insets), conditions, and versatile cross-referencing formats. And Flare doesn't restrict you to a linear, book-based model. You can manage content at the topic level and build multi-sectioned, double-sided books or websites and knowledge bases. Your choice.</p>
<p>Join Eddie VanArsdall as he demonstrates how you can adapt your FrameMaker workflow to a full-on, single-sourcing solution with one tool: MadCap Flare.</p>
<p>Presenter: Eddie VanArsdall, Content Strategist / Technical Writer</p>

<p><strong>Making Your Content Mobile | Feb 23, 10:00-11:00 am (Pacific Time)</strong></p>
<p>This webinar will provide an industry overview of moving different types of content to the mobile environment. Specifically, it will cover developing the following for the mobile environment: (1) HTML content, (2) PDF documents, (3) WebHelp, (4) e-books, and (5) e-learning courses.</p>

<p><strong>Importing Microsoft Word Files into MadCap Flare Projects | Mar 19, 11:00-12:00 pm (Pacific Time)</strong></p>
<p>Need to import Word files into a Flare project but you're not sure what Flare's Word import options do? Or why old and, apparently, well-behaved Word files give odd results when imported into Flare? This webinar addresses both questions.</p>
<p>Flare has a powerful set of Word import features that let you automatically break Word files into topics on import, specify style equivalents between Word and Flare (called “mapping”), and more.</p>
<p>Join Neil Perlin, MadCap-Certified Flare and Mimic instructor and consultant, in this webinar that walks through the process of importing Word files into Flare. We'll look at the mechanics of the process and discuss the kinds of problems that occur in Word files and what to do to fix them.</p>
<p>Presenter: Neil Perlin, Flare Consultant, Content Strategist, Mobile Developer, Hyper/Word Services</p>
