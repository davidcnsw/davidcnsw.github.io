If you work with API documentation, you've probably used [Postman](hhttps://www.getpostman.com/) to make and test API requests. But you can do also a lot more with Postman. For example:

* You can embed [Run in Postman buttons](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/postman_for_publishers/run_button/creating_run_button) that contain collections of requests that users can load in their own Postman clients (perfect for getting started tutorials).
* You can collaborate with engineers on the requests and documentation by syncing collections across a team account (see [Postman Pro](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/pro/what_is_pro)).
* You can [import your OpenAPI specification file](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/postman/collections/data_formats)  directly into Postman and have it populate a collection with the spec's endpoints.
* With just a few clicks, you can also publish and host your documentation through Postman, complete with code samples in multiple programming languages.
* Check out [Postman's API Network](https://www.getpostman.com/api-network/) to see many ways different companies use Postman in their documentation.
