description: "I published a new article on Simplifying Complexity called <a href='https://idratherbewriting.com/simplifying-complexity/reduction-layering-distillation.html'>Reduction, layering, and distillation as a strategy for simplicity</a>. It's all about how reduction and distillation of information helps reduce complexity for users."

In the previous article on Simplifying Complexity, [Ensuring information harmony in the larger documentation landscape](https://idratherbewriting.com/simplifying-complexity/ensuring-information-harmony-in-the-larger-documentation-landscape.html), I argued for the importance of integrating new information into a larger documentation landscape. I explained that it’s easy to create a new article and publish it to a documentation site but much harder to assess whether the new information harmoniously fits in with all the other information on a site (not just harmony with other docs, but with existing forum posts, blog posts, and other information assets). Integrating a small piece of information into a larger body of information requires wide reading and information analysis to determine information fit and harmony.

Conversely, the opposite activity &mdash; taking an existing body of information and distilling its essence down into a smaller information unit (whether that smaller unit is a title, overview, heading, topic sentence, quick reference guide, or some other compressed form of information) also requires cognitive prowess. Crystalizing large information into a brief distillation that captures the main point in as little a space as possible can be a difficult skill that rivals a poet’s astuteness with language and articulation. Despite the difficulty, this distillation is worth it because this content can go a long way towards simplifying a complex system.
