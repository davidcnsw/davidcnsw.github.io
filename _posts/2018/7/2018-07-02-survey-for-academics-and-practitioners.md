description: "The following two surveys will capture the thoughts and attitudes that Tech Comm practitioners and academics have towards each other as members of the same field. The survey takes approximately 1 minute to complete and consists only of 7 selections about whether you agree or disagree (along a scale). Your answers are anonymous. The responses here will be compared to a similar survey administered at a later time."

Take the survey that corresponds to your role. (If you perform both roles, you can take both surveys.)

<a href="https://www.questionpro.com/t/AOaGwZcWtz" target="\_blank"><button type="button" class="btn btn-info">Survey for practitioners to take</button></a> <br/>*Take this survey if you're a practitioner &mdash; e.g., employed as a tech writer for a company*.

<a href="https://www.questionpro.com/t/AOaGwZcWKC" target="\_blank"><button type="button" class="btn btn-warning">Survey for academics to take</button></a> <br/>*Take this survey if you're an academic &mdash; e.g, employed by a college to do research or teach TC courses*.

Thanks for participating in the survey! I'll be discussing some challenges related to academics and practitioners in an upcoming podcast, so stay tuned.
