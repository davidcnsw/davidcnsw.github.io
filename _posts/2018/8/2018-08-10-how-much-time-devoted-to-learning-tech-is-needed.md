One of the most consistent and diverse tech comm podcasts is [10-minute Tech Comm](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/10minute-tech-comm), by Ryan Weber at the University of Alabama. In the most recent episode, called ["Amruta Ranade on Learning New Technology,"](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/uah-technical-writing/10minute-tech-comm/e/supersized-holiday-spectacular-41636141) Ryan talks with Amruta Ranade about her strategy for learning technology. This topic is consistently popular and important to consider as we look for ways to thrive in the developer doc space. Give it a listen and consider subscribing to [10-minute Tech Comm](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/10minute-tech-comm):

The post made me reflect on my own habits (good or bad) for learning technology.

I thought I'd follow up this topic with a fun multi-question poll. There are 5 questions in the poll, and each question appears after you answer the previous:
