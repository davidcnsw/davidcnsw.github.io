Alan Houser noted on Twitter that this podcast is "unusually introspective, always insightful":

Here's a list of some of the topics discussed:

* Why I write so much on my blog, and purposes for writing
* How the personal essay format fits so well into blogging
* Blogging as a means of discovery versus simply expressing knowledge
* The influence of blogs and podcasts, and how this leads to presentations and workshops
* Why a 1,000-word mediocre post might lead to more clicks on ads (the negative influence of social media on writing)
* The growing influence of voice and why I'm reading my longer posts
* The original reason for my series on simplifying complexity, and where there was more disagreement/controversy
* Finding evidence for trends to know which direction we're really moving
* Why academics are also looking at trends (so they can prepare their students for success in the workplace)
* Why job ads often look for candidates that don't exist, such as someone who can program in 5 languages and who also has strong writing abilities
* Why it's so difficult to measure writing as you're evaluating candidates during job searches (and why checking boxes for technical skills is much easier)
* Ellis's perspective as a recruiter in determining what companies are looking for in candidates
* Why deep technical knowledge is essential for writing in the developer domain (if you want to avoid merely being an editor/publisher)
* How you define yourself -- as a generalist, doc tooling specialist, programming languages, API documentation, or other area?
* Why API documentation is getting simpler in part through standards such as the OpenAPI specification
* Why people don't always value writing, and how tech writers are embracing different specializations as a result
* Strategies to reduce complexity by separating tool knowledge from content knowledge
