This week I'm trying something a bit different. Usually, when I'm writing a post for my [Simplifying Complexity series](/simplifying-complexity/), I work on it for a couple of weeks and then publish it. But this week I thought, why not work through my thoughts step by step as I go, blogging about the content here before compiling all my thoughts into a final, finished piece on Simplifying Complexity? So here is the first bit of notes on the next article.

I listened to an interesting Freakonomics podcast the other day called [Evolution, Accelerated](http://freakonomics.com/podcast/evolution-accelerated/). The podcasters discussed the emerging science of gene editing, where genetic engineers can identify a corrupt gene and then catalyze the body's own repair process to fix it.

In the podcast, Jason Fletcher, an economist and co-author of *The Genome Factor*, explains that when the human genome was first mapped, people assumed we would quickly be able to "find single, easily identifiable genes that controlled cancer, or depression, or intelligence, or even just height" &mdash; e.g., the Alzheimer gene, the Gambling Addiction gene, the Depression gene.

Fletcher says this assumption was wrong, noting that it "turns out to be an exception rather than a rule." Instead of single, easily identifiable genes responsible for our maladies, there are actually hundreds of thousands of genes contributing in microscopic ways to the result. Fletcher explains,

> Most of what we care about, most of life’s important outcomes, are not one gene and one disease. They’re more like hundreds or thousands of genes all with really tiny effects, if you can even find them.

Thus, even though the first human genome was [sequenced in 2003](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Genome_Project), we still don't have gene editing. Why not? Because finding the genes responsible turned out to be much more complex than initially thought.

Fast forward a few years, and now you see companies like 23andMe engaged in another effort -- to collect enough human genomes in order to identify correlations between variants and outcomes. 99.5% of human DNA is the same -- just 0.5% varies from one person to the next. Identifying these variants and how those variants correlate with different diseases or traits constitutes much of the work 23andMe. The purpose of the $200 fee for their test isn't to provide a service -- it's to collect your DNA into their ongoing big data project.

What does this all have to do with documentation? As technical writers, we're not mapping the
human genome, but we are doing something similar: we're mapping the end-user. You can think of it almost like a genetic engineer looking at DNA strands under a powerful microscope. We're figuratively doing the same -- trying to understand how the user's brain chemistry and wiring work. What does the user need to know, want to know, not know? What actions or behaviors and thoughts drive the user's behavior? Who *is* the user, and what information do they need?

Despite the need to understand the end-user, the technical writing profession is mostly a solitary one, separated from end users. As a technical writer, I spend the majority of my day sitting at my computer, working alone on documentation. I'm writing for a user I almost never interact with. I'm making decisions about the language and terms the user will speak with, the tasks the user will want to do, the questions and problems the user will encounter, the business scenario and purpose the user will follow, and more.

And yet, even though the user centers and guides every decision that I make as a writer -- the thousand little decisions that guide how I write and shape and organize the documentation -- this user is almost never present, is someone I almost never interact with, see, hear, or otherwise observe. How is it that we can write successfully for an absent user that we barely know and understand? And if we can't better conceptualize and understand this user, then how can we be confident that the content we write will connect with that future-present reader?

The most fundamental rule of writing is that you write for a reader, but if you have very little understanding or interaction with that reader, how can you possibly hope to connect with what he or she wants and needs to know? Is it any wonder why technical documentation across the whole tends to be bad, why it tends to be constantly degraded and dismissed by people as unhelpful? How can we close the gap between this invisible, absent reader and make him or her present?

This same question 20 years ago would have been challenging, but today each user leaves a "digital trail" that we can follow. By analyzing the digital trail, we can reconstruct the user (like an archeologist reconstructing a Paleolithic scene) and understand this user as if present. Closing this gap constitutes one of the most important tasks in technical writing because without a clear conception and understanding of the reader, writing itself is impossible. In the absence of a real user, we end up writing for ourselves.
