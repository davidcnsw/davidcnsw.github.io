description: "Previously, I explored the use of embedded maps to help guide users through larger processes. But all the maps I showed were linear maps. What about maps for non-linear, complex systems? In the Simplifying Complexity section of my site, I added a new tutorial for navigating through more non-linear, complex spaces. The strategy involves tagging content with metadata so that it can be surfaced to the users in the right context."
