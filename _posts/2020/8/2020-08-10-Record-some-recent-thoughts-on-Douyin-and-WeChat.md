# 1 What is Wechat and Douyin?

WeChat is a mobile instant text and voice messaging communication service and has become an important social media platform in China[1].

Douyin a social networking app for creating and sharing 15 seconds to one minute videos by which users can use a variety of filters, BGM (background Music) and lip-synching templates to communicate to the online community of viewers[2,3].

# 2 Why choose WeChat and Douyin?

WeChat and Douyin are the two main sources of information for Chinese students.

## 2.1 WeChat

By this year, WeChat monthly active users have exceeded 1.1 billion[4]. 

With 1.4 billion people across the country, WeChat monthly active users have reached 1.1 billion, making it the most popular APP in China. This makes WeChat the best choice for us to contact prospective students in mainland China.

WeChat currently has 1.5 million monthly Australian users[5]. 

WeChat is also very good tools to provide graduate application information and consulting services to undergraduates already studying in Australia (e.g. our current undergraduate student, transfer student from other institutions, or other normal users in Australia). 

 

An ordinary use’s official account [5]

 

In a first post, an user wrote in Chinese: “I hope to establish closer channels of communication with Chinese Australians through this WeChat account to present my work and national policies.”

 

## 2.2 Douyin

According to the latest data report released by Douyin in January 2020, Douyin’s daily active users have reached 400 million, and Douyin users spend an average of 76 minutes per day browsing videos [6]. These data reflect that Douyin has become a highly viscous and highly active platform like WeChat and Weibo [7].

In terms of qualifications of the users, Douyin has higher qualifications users, with first- and second-tier cities accounting for 50% [6]. This shows that Douyin's users have high income levels.

After March 2020, the number of Douyin users has increased significantly. QuestMobile released the "2020 China Mobile Internet Spring Report". The report pointed out that the number of monthly active users of the mobile Internet in March 2020 exceeded 1.156 billion. The average monthly usage time per person per day increased from 5.6 hours last year to 7.2 hours, an increase of 28.6% [8].

 


 

## 2.3 What is the difference between WeChat and Facebook Messenger/ WhatsApp?

You cannot log in to Facebook/WhatsApp in China.

Due to long-term use habits and social circles, this is why most Chinese students are not used to using Facebook.

 

## 2.4 What is the difference between Douyin and Instagram?

You cannot log in to Instagram in China.

 

Other similar Questions

What is the difference between Douyin and Vine, Youtube, Vimeo, Tumblr, Hulu, Dailymotion?

Guess the answer.

 

## 2.5 What is the difference between Douyin and Tiktok?

Douyin can only be downloaded in China, Main users are Chinese

Tiktok can only be downloaded outside of China, Main users are outside of mainland China

 

The functions are similar, but the content is not interoperable.
