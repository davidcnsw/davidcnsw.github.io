description: "I updated the Introduction to API documentation topic in my API doc course in a couple of significant ways. First, I expanded on the many different types of APIs out there (beyond REST). The list now native library APIs, SOAP APIs, RPC-based APIs, gRPC APIs, REST APIs, Voice Assistant APIs, and IoT APIs. I also incorporated research from Smartbear's impressive report called <a href='https://static1.smartbear.co/smartbearbrand/media/pdf/smartbear_state_of_api_2019.pdf'><i>The State of API 2019</i></a>, which is well worth a read on its own."
