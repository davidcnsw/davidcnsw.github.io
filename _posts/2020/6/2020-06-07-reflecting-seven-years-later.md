The recent guest post on [why technical writers are treated as unimportant in a company](/blog/why-technical-writers-treated-as-unimportant/), by Jeremy Rosselot-Merritt, received a lot of clicks and comments, as I believe this topic struck a nerve with people.

One of Jeremy's points was that others in a company are often unaware of the communication value or role that technical communicators provide with information; some just assume technical communicators facilitate communication work that others do. In other words, tech comm people provide the tools that others use to fill in with content.

In the comments, Mark Baker said that deep product and company knowledge is more important (when layoffs are considered) because it helps with business continuity, while the ability to quickly learn what you need to know makes you much more expendable. Others agreed. In contrast, Robert Kennedy shared a post called [Most Tech Writing Is Neither](https://medium.com/@becometechnicalwriter/most-technical-writing-is-neither-e67e4d2bfda), where he argues that "Most technical writers are mostly aggregators or synthesizers of content. It's collecting, researching, analyzing, synthesizing, and editing content." I've also deliberated between the choice of being a specialist or generalist in a number of posts, such as this one: [Principle 11: Be both a generalist and specialist at the same time](/simplifying-complexity/both-a-generalist-and-specialist-at-same-time.html).

In thinking about how to respond, I realized that discussions about why people are laid off are mostly speculative. We don't often have the data or explicit reasons about why layoffs occur. Yet being laid off is emotionally scarring. As a means of collecting real data, I thought it would be productive to write a post inviting those who have been laid off to tell their stories and speculate about the reasons why they were laid off. And I want to begin that post by telling my layoff story.

I've worked for five different companies in my 15-year tech comm career, and I've only been laid off from one of the companies. Back in 2013, I was working for the Corporation of the LDS Church in Utah, in their technology department, which had about 1,000 people, mostly based in Riverton, Utah. I was on a team of five other writers. I had been there about five years and never suspected any instability in my job.

One day a new company head (a new "presiding bishop" in this case) took over, and like most new CEOs, after about six months into his role, he started making some changes. I believe that he either wanted to cut costs from the technology budget, perhaps to move money into other channels, or perhaps he wanted to optimize the budget in some way. At any rate, the entire job function was cut and moved to an external group. One writer who also handled Intellectual Property approvals stayed on but only in an IP role, not in a tech comm role. After a year, he left. The team lead, who managed internal corporate communications, also stayed on for a few years doing internal communications before being let go.

In a 2013 article titled [LDS Church announces limited layoffs](https://www.deseret.com/2013/1/23/20513017/lds-church-announces-limited-layoffs), a newspaper columnist wrote about this layoff, which affected 5 to 8% of the church. Apparently, the reasons for the layoff were "'a planned reduction in workforce' as a result of the 'evolving needs of a global church.'" The article explains,

> "The action is based solely on the need to be sure that resources are being used wisely to meet the evolving needs of a global church," Purdy said, indicating that it is not a matter of declining budgets, but rather a matter of "reassigning budgets to meet current needs."

They wanted to be clear that the Church wasn't in financial straits but rather had shifting priorities.

As I imagine is the case with most layoffs, reasons were vague and the aftereffects shocking. We knew the layoffs were coming, since they were announced a month in advance so that we could get our affairs in order, so to speak. Since I'd already been there for five years and wanted exposure to more technical products, I was planning to leave soon anyway. The day the layoffs actually happened, we were called into meet with HR on a one-on-one basis and would return with a green folder. We didn't know our entire job function was being eliminated until we all had green folders on our desks.

The severance package was generous, especially because it was weighted based on your number of years at the company. With this severance money, I decided to relocate to Santa Clara, California, and here in the Bay area I got into API documentation. I've been in Santa Clara for seven years and have worked at several different companies since then.

As I said earlier, layoffs are emotionally scarring. Not only do you wonder for the rest of your career why you were laid off, but there's also the nagging urge to avoid a repeat layoff in the future. As the primary breadwinner for a family of six people, job stability and regular salary is key to my economic survival.

The problem with layoffs is the uncertainty the event creates, without full understanding about how it could have been prevented, or how one can prevent it in the future. This is in part why the question in Jeremy's post was so poignant.

I have wrestled in my mind to understand the reasons for the layoff. I'm only left to speculate, but I wanted to invite my colleagues to also speculate about the reasons as well. First, you have to understand that this technology company was part of the LDS Church, so the CEO, or presiding bishop, has a different mandate. I'm not even sure I entirely understand how funding and roles work, but the presiding bishop oversees funding from specific channels, including tithing, which is member donations. We were often told that our salaries were the equivalent of an entire ward's tithing from a ward in Africa over the course of an entire year, or something. Hence we needed to work diligently, be grateful, and waste our time, which was sanctified in some ways.

My guess is that the new presiding bishop felt the technology group was overfunded and wanted to reduce costs. I like to think he wanted to redirect money towards more humanitarian channels, but who knows. At any rate, someone cutting costs decided that the tech comm role could be outsourced at a more effective cost rate. We had been allocating our hours on projects for years, each week indicating how many hours we each spent on each project. I think at some point, a cost analyzer counted up the hours, multiplied them by our cost rate, and compared the result with a similar cost from an external group that would provide this same function. Since the external group could do it cheaper, they opted for this route instead. In the cost analysis, going about it any other way would be a waste of tithing money. And didn't the CEO have a moral duty to the members to avoid waste?

In the years that followed, we watched to see if their experiment worked or not. Were they able to outsource the tech comm group to an external agency? Well, things got a bit messy. Some of the laid-off technical writers started working for the external agency at higher salaries than their previous role. Then after about six months, the LDS technology group did re-hire a technical writer on a contract basis.

My colleagues went various ways. One stayed in Utah working on various contracts. He spent about nine months trying to land a permanent job before deciding to switch careers into business analysis. So this layoff ended his tech comm career.

Another colleague decided to create his own company. He had good project management skills and he ramped up his knowledge of MadCap Flare to become a consultant. He did very well in this role for a number of years before returning back to full-time employment at another company in Utah.

Another colleague did volunteer work for some months while attempting to get hired on with another Church department in an area she was passionate about. Unfortunately, the other Church department also had a lot of volunteers, and so getting hired on full-time in the role she wanted was tough.

Another colleague took up work at another company for a while, mostly in a similar tech comm role.

Coming back to the original discussion, were we laid off because we didn't have deep product knowledge that contributed to business continuity? In this case, no. I did have deep product knowledge. I believe we were laid off because the hours we spent on each project were greater than the bidded hours for similar work from an external agency. In this case, it might have been better to perform more of a generalist role with each project where we asked the product team to provide the content while we mostly handled the editorial review, tooling, and publishing process. This would have kept our hours down on each project so that an external company could not have "out-bid" us.
