some more notes.
relevance: started this as a part of a review process. thought it would be good to reflect and think through some of these things.

- ***do it all myself.***
- let people get under my skin.
- focus too much on tools.
- let trivial things take priority.
- don't insist on enough person-to-person interactions.
- could be better organized. seems like i bounce from emergency to emergency.
- i get frustrated when people don't listen to me or trust me
- sleep at irregular hours
- not involved enough in my kids' lives
- could lose 30 lbs
- let my temper flare too easily when playing ball
- sometimes i buy stuff on amazon late at night and then regret it in the morning
- watch way too much football, bball and other sports
- don't read enough
- books i listen to are junk food assasin fiction
- i don't sleep in regular times.
- my posting on this blog has been irregular, unorganized
- never eat lunch with my colleagues
- quick to judge others
- last two jobs i was there 1.5 yrs only
- constantly make goals that i can't keep
- constantly change my goals
-

is it good to even do this?

will recognizing my weaknesses help me improve them?

perhaps others can point out ways for me to overcome my weaknesses?

maybe my weaknesses are not what i think?

sometimes it's very difficult to see and analyze yourself. i am extremely biased in my view. like fighting a war while you're in it, you're stuck looking at the trees and can't see the forest.

- this is not like that interview question where your biggest weakness turns out to be a strength in disguise, though perhaps that's what the annual review process is really asking for?

- biggest reasons not to promote: could potentially something ....
