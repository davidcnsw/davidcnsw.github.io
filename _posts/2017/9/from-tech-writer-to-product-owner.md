what is diff betw product owner and tech writer?
- a prod owner decides direction (cont strat) while a tech writer follows the outlined direction

why might some products not have owners?
- not high enough priority

if a product has no owner, does it have a business priority?
- prob. not. maybe if no one is asking for doc, we shouldn't be focusing on it. maybe it has little value to the business of the company. one has only so much bandwidth. focus on where the $$ is.

what kinds of doc falls thru the cracks?
- lots of fringe support questions.
- 3p apps that aren't installed by anyone.

what opps are there 4 you to fill?
- higher priority stuff going on -- catalog??? watch n shop.

what are potential cons of stepping into something that isn't a biz priority?
- eventually you get disbanded or redirected with your priority

how do you act like a prod owner?
- you own the product from end to end.

can you be both a prod owner and an indiv contrib?
- yes, but tis kind of hard. but yeah, you are more like a content strat

how does content strat diff from product owner?
- no really sure. mostly same i think.

is this your first step toward content strat?
- yes, i think so.

are tech writers who follow basic commands the tacticians, while prod owners are the strats?
- yes
