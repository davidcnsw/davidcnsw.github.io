-------------------

are we more interested in the critical thinking mindset than with the subject itself?

- ramifications: any subject can be potentially interesting
- person who studies history while working as a tech writer.... you could have just studied something tech writing
- are we fascinated to see the way people think?
- descarte's essay ... brilliant to see a mind in motion, thinking and analyzing
- my experiment at columbia: 10 for 10. go deep. find that we connect into larger issues at some point. like all roads leading to rome.
- the more trivial, the more interesting. the philosophy of oranges. the philosophy of sidewalks. whole books have been written about the pencil. the ability to see something interesting in something that everyone else misses. revisionist history. turn something known upside down on its head, show another side of it.
- how sustainable?
- problem with this inquiry language.... problem with using language as a tool for inquiry is that you can use it as such, but you don't want that to be your final product. you then convert this meandering brainstorming prose into an essay that seems as if you knew these points all along. or does the user want to go along for the ride with all the twists and turns?
- what if you could convert your mind into a thinking thing? become more of a philosophical thinker?
- can language be used as a tool for thinking? this is kind of what separates out good bloggers from bad ones.
- language lets us extend out thoughts, hold more ideas out. they quickly vanish if you can't write them down. also lets you see what you're thinking, so not only do you remember them, you can also think more thoroughly?
- yes, but dont write about writing. that is boring, esp. if you are expounding on a theory. instead, show us evidence. what is something banal about tech writing?
