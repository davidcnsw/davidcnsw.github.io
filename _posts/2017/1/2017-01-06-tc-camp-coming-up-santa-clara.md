description: "TC Camp is holding its annual free unconference for Tech Comm on Jan. 21 in Santa Clara. TC Camp starts with morning workshops given by experts in the field for a nominal fee. The unconference follows, where attendees vote on the topics to be discussed. It's a great event for networking and exchanging ideas, and I'll definitely be there."

The TC Camp Unconference is one of my favorite conferences for a number of reasons:

* The sessions are user-led
* The audience consists mainly of Bay area tech writers
* It's free and just 2 miles from my house

To learn more TC Camp, see the previous interview I did with Liz Fraley: [Why is the TC Camp Unconference format so popular? Interview with Liz Fraley, TC Camp Founder](https://idratherbewriting.com/2016/01/06/tc-camp-unconference-interview-with-liz-fraley/)

Before the unconference, several morning workshops are held (for minimal fees). Additionally, the day before the conference, on January 20, [Peter Gruenbaum](https://www.udemy.com/user/petergruenbaum/), president of SDK Bridge and author of four online courses on writing API documentation on Udemy, each of which I have reviewed on this site ([1][1], [2][2], [3][3], [4][4]), will be giving a full-day [API workshop](http://www.tccamp.org/2016/12/api-workshop-tc-camp-west-2017/). This workshop is a great opportunity to learn API documentation from a guru in the field.
