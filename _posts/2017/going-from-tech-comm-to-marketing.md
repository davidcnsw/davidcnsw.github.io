the basic idea: how did the transformation happen?

first attendance of intelligent content. intel content is synonym for dita.
evolution of structured content
contentful
- instead of creating standalone content, re-use it
- how to create a conference that appeals to both marketers and tech writers. this is the chasm to cross.
- evolution of marketing to be more strategic about the content
- evolution: single sourcing the content, adapting the content
- not doing structured content with intelligent resurfacing via a cms
- contentful is best way to achieve this brokering

I was checking out the Intelligent Content Conference site today and musing about the transformation of its audience. ICC started out as a conference mainly for technical writers creating structured content. Common strategies for structured content usually included DITA XML and component content management systems that could act on the metadata to surface content in intelligent ways.

After the acquisition of the conference by the Content Management Institute, the target audience is now more aligned to marketers instead of technical writers. But the basic strategy is the same: structuring content so that you can more intelligently re-use it, surface it when needed, and deliver it to the right person at the right time on the right device.

I think the original intention was to create a conference that broke down silos between marketing and tech comm, allowing for content to flow freely across these channels and create a unified customer experience. Alternatively, it could have been for content marketers to learn how to leverage structured content models to evolve marketing to a more strategic level.

But with a focus now on marketers instead of both "technical writers and marketers," it seems like we're back to the silos again. Technical writers will implement their content re-use strategies through their DITA XML and component content management systems. And marketing writers will implement their content re-use strategies through some other method (Contentful?). I highly doubt that content will flow freely across the different systems. The fact that the audiences couldn't be merged seems like a strong argument that the silos will continue within companies as well.

Overall, maybe technical writing and marketing writing (or content marketing content) are just too different to bring these two groups together to collaborate in productive ways. One group works on a white paper that highlights a case study with a customer, while the other group writes a getting started tutorial for an SDK.

If we're going to break silos, the easier silo to break is the one between support and tech docs. In this case there is a real use case for repurposing content.
