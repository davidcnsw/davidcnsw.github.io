video notes

i = interlaced
p = progressive

you always want progressive

rule of thirds
24 or 30 FPS

create more interest by changing angles on your subject -- use a variety of shots
give the viewer room to move by showing where they're headed

video frame rate
progressive or interlaced
optimal dimensions 1280x720
audio bitrate: mono 128kbps (must match that of the video)
output format: mp4

you can't edit past events on meetup.com or associate the video there in any way b/c the product designers are fascists.

canon vixia sucks at focusing on 4 different people
canon vixia splits out files at 4 gb length
there was a 60p setting that was prob. unnecessary
you need 50 gb of space to do this. start deleting stuff now.
your first upload to a youtube channel restricts the length you can upload
sound from vixia just as good as from my recorder at front of room
iphone 5 video is probably better than vixia.
camtasia can handle large video
export as mp4 and mp4 as main concept
audio rates differ among recording devices.
