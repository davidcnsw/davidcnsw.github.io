## The active, self-directed technical writer

I'm fond of a more active tech writer. Rather than passively being assigned task items, or being under the management of the project manager, what if tech writers were more self-directed, autonomous, and aggressive in researching documentation needs? Instead of expecting managers to include you or push information out to you, or to assign you doc items, to assign points, etc., you can create your own task items based on your research of the features, your user analysis, market research, internal company knowledge, and other independent knowledge.

The tech writer I imagine is the one Larry Kunz writes about in his [A Visit from St. Techwriter](https://larrykunz.wordpress.com/2016/12/19/a-visit-from-st-techwriter/). It's the guy who comes in at the last hour, arriving in a Lamborghini, to save a team of developers from a poor software execution. He cranks out "User guide. Help pages. API docs." to salvage the product from all its glitches and foibles.

The tech writer is a strategist when it comes to product and doc needs. The writer scours incoming support tickets, forum posts, threads on Stack Overflow, and gets a pulse on the voice of the user. The writer looks across company products and drinks deep in company knowledge to bring in big-picture information about other corporate projects and efforts with overlapping goals or functionality. The writer assesses weak points in the product and suggests improvements, suggests ways to fix functionality and interfaces instead of merely applying documentation bandaids.

Edwin Dawson explains that they keep pace with agile through meticulous online tracking:
> ... We’ve persistently found that by tracking the information flow continuously, monitoring changes Jedi style, we win critical days, hours and minutes that we then have up our sleeves to finish the job in time, no matter what’s happened. The flip side of our obsession is that usually, none of the software developers would have thought to inform us about some critical change that turns our priorities upside down. They’re bumbling along, hacking away in their IDE, humming blithely to themselves as the crisis bears down over days and weeks. Rather than a scheduled disaster, “Abracadabra”! We’ve magically got time to finish our work for the release."

You don't need to attend physical meetings ad nauseum to do this continuous information tracking. You can look at repository commit histories, code review notifications, wiki space updates, watched wiki pages, status reports, and myriad other ways of detecting relevant information &mdash; if you just reach out and immerse yourself in the potential sources of information.

The active tech writer is one step ahead of the project team. He or she is someone who has pushed the product through the process from beginning to end, one of the few with a true sample application with lifelike data. The writer doesn't attend the endless developer meetings with little relevance; like the most interesting man in the world, if there's a group of people there, it's because he called the meeting. If there's an elephant in the room, it's because he brought it.

The writer doesn't sit passively like a fly on the wall, hoping that developers will mention something relevant to documentation. The writer instead actively goes to developers in their cubes, asking for demos, explanations, or other needed details for the documentation efforts he or she is leading. The tech writer is active and exuberant.

Alyssa Fox also has good advice for interacting with teams. She writes:

>Regardless of the type of development environment you are in, to be an equal player, the onus is on you. Take the initiative: speak up in meetings, request invitations to those meetings, offer feedback—in other words, get involved in all aspects of the product development. This level of involvement tunes you into the project from the beginning, with obvious benefits: knowing the requirements, design, and thought process behind the design of the software. Ask lots of questions—lots and lots of questions—but make them count. If you hear something in a design meeting that doesn’t make sense to you, or you think there’s a better approach, say so. Don’t be intimidated by the fact that you’re not a developer—chances are the product manager and the marketing team know less about code than you do."

You don't have to attend every meeting to make this happen. Your attendance at meetings can be selective and purposeful. Attend when you want a venue to reach all developers, when you want to inform them of user feedback, your thoughts on the design, or other comments about the direction of the project. You don't need to be a passive attendee of a meeting for which you have little input or reason to attend.

You don't just get tasks assigned to you. You assign the tasks to yourself. You scour the landscape by looking across tickets, releases, press, media, other teams, and you dive deep into  product learning and ramp up on expertise on the whole prouct. You're a product expert, a researcher, an ever curious learner who is obsessed with product information and user assistance. The active tech writer is fully consumed by this self-initiated drive.

By nature the active tech writer's is a lonely role. If the active tech writer has a nickname, it would be the same as Jimmer Freddette's Chinese nickname: [The Lonely God](http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865671226/Morning-links-Jimmer-Fredette-called-a-Lonely-God-NBA-power-rankings-BYU-LSU-football-game.html). Jimmer is a highly celebrated scoring machine for a Chinese basketball team, averaging 37 points per game.

Returning to my original survey response, yes, it is a lonely role. As a tech writer, you are one-of-a-kind on the team. No one else summons the voice of the user like you do, no one else has the big-picture vision, the first-user outsider's mentality, no one else champions the user and user assistance like you do. You are lonely because your role is unique, and your role is powerful and shaping.

In China, the "lonely God" isn't a derogatory adjective. It refers more to being so awesome and powerful, no others are higher. But because you are so unique and powerful and alone, you are also by nature isolated and lonely. This is a fitting description for technical writers to aspire to -- a lonely god.

I wanted to find a new term to describe this model. You could make a case for calling it a "content strategist," since it involves an element of strategy. But that term has a lot of baggage, so maybe an "active, self-directed technical writer."


Is tech writing a lonely career? Yes, it just might be. But is that necessarily a bad thing? Don't writers prefer introversion? Wouldn't a career as a novelist also be lonely, with a lot of time sequestered away by yourself writing? In some way, we probably choose to work this way because it fits out psyche.

Nevertheless, the more active you are, the more touchpoints you create with others inside and outside the company. You might have a string of meetings (most of which you set up yourself). You work with a lot of engineers, but you never work so closely with the same engineers that you develop lasting bonds. We project hop and as such, only develop artificial relationships with those we work with. Perhaps the fundamental characteristic of being a tech writer is to be lonely, that independent, autonomous writer.

Neither do we develop close relationships with other writers, since we specialize along different product lines.
