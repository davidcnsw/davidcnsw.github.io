<p>Rob explains how you can use Captivate to create nontraditional e-learning materials, such as on-the-job training, sales and marketing training, or even bird-watching training. You aren't just limited to technical how-to information in screen demos. Rob recommends Brenda Huettner's book on Captivate and also Ruth Clark's book on Building Expertise. You can also use resources on his own site, at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.userassistance.com" title="User Assistance">www.userassistance.com</a>.</source></audio></p>
