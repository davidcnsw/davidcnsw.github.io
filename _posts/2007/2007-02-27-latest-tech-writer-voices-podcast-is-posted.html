<p>If you haven't started listening to podcasts yet because you don't have time, try fitting in podcasts during these hours:</p>
<ul>
<li>While you're driving to work</li>
<li>While you're exercising</li>
<li>While you lie down at night to fall asleep</li>
<li>While you're walking your dog</li>
<li>While you're running errands</li>
<li>While you're shopping for groceries</li>
<li>While you're bicycling around your neighborhood</li>
<li>While you're reformatting your computer</li>
<li>While you're watching your kids play on the playground</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, you get the point. Podcasts are what you listen to while you're doing something else. I mostly listen to podcasts while driving or exercising. To listen to podcasts in the car, you'll need an FM transmitter. I use an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/iRiver-AFT-100-Mobile-Transmitter/dp/B00067LYFW" target="_blank">FM transmitter from iRiver</a> and it works great. FM transmitters are available at any Best Buy or Radio Shack store. Listening to podcasts will totally change your experience of driving or exercising.</p>
