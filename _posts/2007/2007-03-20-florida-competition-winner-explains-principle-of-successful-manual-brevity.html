<p>Today I became convinced of something I'd always known: shorter is better. While driving to our Florida Tech. Comm. Competition showcase event, I listened to a South by Southwest podcast on <a href="http://2006.sxsw.com/coverage/podcasts/" target="_blank">"How to Add Video to Your Blog."</a> (I actually had my videocamera with me to take footage at the event.) The vloggers explained that 3 minutes is the max length you want. At that point, the reader gets the point.</p>
<p>I was also looking at <a href="http://copyblogger.com" target="_blank">Copyblogger's posts</a> â€” all nicely chunked material, with short paragraphs, subheads, and lists, just as any tech writer would organize help. And I looked at Nielsen's <a href="http://www.useit.com/eyetracking/" target="_blank">heatmap results from an eye-tracking survey</a>. Readers scan the first three paragraphs and then wander elsewhere.</p>
<p>But it was Amy Weiss's acceptance remarks for winning Best of Show that cemented the principle of brevity for me. Her Motorola quick guide, a manual you can fit in your pocket, delivered exactly what users want: a short, easy-to-consume guide. Weiss explained that selecting the topics required intense deliberation and thought. Which leads to another irony: shorter is harder. But this time I'm taking the advice to heart. My posts are too long. I'm going to be more brief.</p>
<p>If I have to write more, I'll use subheads. I think long blog posts are symptomatic of unclear thoughts. But that is one reason we write: to figure out what we think.</p>
