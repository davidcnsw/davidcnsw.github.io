<p>I'm excited to upgrade to RoboHelp 6, but would you believe that RoboHelp 6 <a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/webforums/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=447&threadid=1233179#4438781" target="_blank">isn't compatible with Word 2007</a>? Oh my.</p>
<p>I assume RoboHelp will have to offer another release fairly soon.</p>
<p>Monkey PI has <a href="http://monkeypi.net/?p=133" target="_blank">a really interesting review</a> of RoboHelp 6, calling it "craptastic."</p>
