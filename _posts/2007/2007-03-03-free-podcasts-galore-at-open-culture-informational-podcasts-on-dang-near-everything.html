<p>Free podcasts over at <a href="http://www.oculture.com/weblog/" target="_blank">http://www.oculture.com/weblog/</a>. (Actually, 99% of podcasts are free, but it's an adjective that never hurts.) The sheer volume of worthwhile, information podcasts listed on this <a href="http://www.oculture.com/weblog/" target="_blank">Open Culture</a> is amazing. I'm going to be spending a few hours just grabbing all the podcast feeds into my FeedDemon newsreader. Wish they had a big OPML file sitting over there. There are also good podcast recommendations in the comments sections.</p>
