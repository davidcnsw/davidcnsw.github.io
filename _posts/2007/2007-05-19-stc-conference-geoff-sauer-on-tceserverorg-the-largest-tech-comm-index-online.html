<p>Geoff is one of the founders of <a target="_blank" href="http://tc.eserver.org" title="tc.eserver.org">tc.eserver.org</a> – the largest online index for all works related to technical communication. The library indexes works by technical communicators in dozens of categories, and allows users to add new works, rank them, and get RSS feeds of specific topics. There are over 25,000 RSS feeds generated on the site and 15,000 visitors each day. <a target="_blank" href="http://tc.eserver.org" title="tc.eserver.org">Tc.eserver.org</a> is five times as popular as stc.org. Geoff also shares an upcoming bibliography feature the site will soon have. Overall this is a very cool site – see if anything you wrote (either an article, blog post, or podcast) is already indexed in the library.</source></audio></p>
