<p>Scott's presentation on Web 2.0 was the most popular presentation of the entire conference (at least this is my impression from these interviews). In his presentation, Scott touches upon RSS feeds, wikis, blogs, geospatial positioning, social networking, tagging, podcasts, and other Web 2.0 technologies. He expands here on geospatial positioning and tagging. Scott also explains why he uses a newsletter in addition to a feed for his popular blog, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thecontentwrangler.com" title="The Content Wrangler">www.thecontentwrangler.com</a>.</source></audio></p>
