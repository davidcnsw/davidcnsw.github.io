<p>I interviewed about three dozen people at the STC Conference in Minneapolis this year. If you scroll down and look at the last 34 podcasts published on this site, you'll see that they're tagged with STC Conference or Leadership Day (which is part of the conference).</p>
<p>Each podcast is short, about 5-10 minutes. Interviewees include both presenters and attendees. To download the podcasts, right-click the download links and select Save Target As (Internet Explorer) or Save Link As (Firefox). Note: If the player stops working on the site, refresh your browser.</p>
<p>I was not allowed to record the actual educational sessions, so I did these interviews in the convention center, hotel lobbies, restaurant, expo, book signing area, walkway, and park areas. Let me know what you think of these conference-casts by posting feedback in the comments below or by <a href="mailto:tomjoht@gmail.com">sending me an e-mail</a>.</p>
<p>Please let those who did not attend the conference know about these podcasts. If you could mention this site, www.idratherbewriting.com, on your chapter listserv, SIG listserv, other listserv, blog, or website, I would appreciate it. Thanks.</p>
