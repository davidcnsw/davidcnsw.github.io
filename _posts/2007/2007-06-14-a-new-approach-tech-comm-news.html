<p>In this podcast, Heidi and I try to cover the latest news related to the technical communication field. We amassed a number of newsworthy items on a wiki and talked about most of these items. For shownotes, see the <a target="_blank" href="https://idratherbewriting.com/wiki/doku.php?id=june_12_2007_podcast_news" title="shownotes/news archive for June 14, 2007">wiki archive page</a>.
