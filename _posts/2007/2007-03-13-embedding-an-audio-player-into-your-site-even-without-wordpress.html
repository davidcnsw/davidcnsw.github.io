<p>Several people have asked me about how to embed an audio player into their websites. I use the <a href="http://www.mightyseek.com/podpress/" target="_blank">PodPress plugin</a> for WordPress, but this plugin itself is based on an audio player by 1 Pixel Out.</p>
<p>If you have a regular HTML website and want to start embedding an audio player (for example, to play recordings of your chapter presentations or other audio broadcasts), check out this player from <a href="http://www.1pixelout.net/code/audio-player-wordpress-plugin/" target="_blank">1 Pixel Out.</a></p>
<p>Well-written instructions <a href="http://www.macloo.com/examples/audio_player/" target="_blank">for non-WordPress users are here</a>. They look fairly simple. You do need to upload some files to a directory. If you do start using this player on your site, send me the link so I can check out your audio.</p>
