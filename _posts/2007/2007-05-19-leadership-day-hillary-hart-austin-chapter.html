<p>Hillary says she's taking home a new perception about the STC's support of chapters (which was previously questionable). As a professor at the University of Texas, she's also interested in the collaborations between academic and industry practitioners, and is excited about getting the profession defined, accepted, and more valued. She also says she hasn't noticed any attrition among tech comm. students in the academia.</source></audio></p>
