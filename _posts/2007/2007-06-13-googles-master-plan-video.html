<p><a href="http://wion.com/" target="_blank">Destry Wion</a> pointed out this video detailing <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x178mj_masterplan-of-google" target="_blank">Google's Master Plan</a> to me. Really interesting presentation to watch. Google's simple motto is "Don't be evil," but as they achieve total human omniscience, won't it be tempting to start abusing that power? I hope they use it for good -- such as catching criminals and stopping terrorists, rather than empowering marketers.</p>
<p>Google is still viewed as cool; if they abuse their power, they'll lose that image and turn into Microsoft, which someone once described as the Darth Vader of Tech. It would be an interesting study to contrast the public images of Google vs. Microsoft and how each got that way.</p>
