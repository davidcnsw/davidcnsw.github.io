<p>One of the responses in our recent <a href="http://www.surveygizmo.com/reports/771/1023/ER5YAMH5Z4A8PC7FLO7IK6H7XB2WIV/" target="_blank">chapter survey</a> showed that members want more information about other members (see #3). I think this means members want to interact more, to get to know their peers better.</p>
<p>But going out to the meetings each month isn't always possible given the remote locations of some members. And others have family commitments or other obstacles that prevent them from interacting.</p>
<p>To get around this, I've added a chat feature to the <a href="http://stc-suncoast.org/chat" target="_blank">Suncoast chapter site</a>. I hope to start experimenting with virtual get-togethers. I'm not sure what topic would work â€” maybe just an evening of introductions. Has anyone ever done member chats? Does it work well? My feeling is that it may require someone to direct and lead the discussion on a certain topic.</p>
