<p>Up until now, the blog and podcast have been going in two different directions. I decided it's time to unify them more. They are still two separate sites, but they now mirror each other in theme. I plan to use the blog to accumulate topics that I will eventually talk more freely about in the podcast.</p>
<p>I'm also planning a little different direction for the podcast. Previously, I've mostly interviewed other people. In the upcoming year, I plan to do moreÂ cohost podcasts podcasts.</p>
<p><strong>10/5/07 Update:</strong> As you can see if you've been following my blog and the Tech Writer Voices podcast, I scrapped both of these ideas.</p>
