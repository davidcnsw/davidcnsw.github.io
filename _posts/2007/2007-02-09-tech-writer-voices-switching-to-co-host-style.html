<p>If you've ever listened to the <a target="_blank" href="http://revision3.com/diggnation">Diggnation podcast</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.twit.tv/node/4192">TWIT </a>(This Week in Tech), <a target="_blank" href="http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-11455_7-6457370-1.html">Buzz Out Loud</a>, the <a target="_blank" href="http://wp-community.org/category/podcast">WordPress podcast</a>, or other popular podcasts, one thing they have in common is co-hosting. And this is the new direction we're taking with the <a target="_blank" href="https://idratherbewriting.com">Tech Writer Voices podcast</a>.</p>
<p>Until now, Tech Writer Voices has largely been a podcast of interviews. But now we will switch to the co-host style and be more conversational. The focus of the podcast will not be dedicated to one single topic, but instead cover a variety of topics related to technical communciation, and the style will flow conversationally between me and the new co-host, <a target="_blank" href="http://heidilhansen.blogspot.com/index.html">Heidi Hansen</a>. We also plan to limit the podcast to 15-20 minutes.</p>
<p>I'm excited about the new format. We're also going to try to increase the audio quality by doing a technique described in <em>Podcasting Hacks</em> as the "double ender." Each person records on their own computers, and then the tracks are layered (rather than just recording straight from Skype, which results in a loss of quality).</p>
<p>One reason I think Heidi will make a good co-host is because she's very well-read. She's always posting summaries and recommendations of journal articles, books, and other content she has read. I have never actually met her — she lives in Seattle and is part of the Puget Sound Chapter. Heidi is also a triathlete.</p>
<p>If you haven't gotten into podcasting yet, but you spend time driving in your car each day or working out, then you are a prime candidate to get into podcasting. We should post the first co-hosted podcast sometime next week. Look for it.</p>
