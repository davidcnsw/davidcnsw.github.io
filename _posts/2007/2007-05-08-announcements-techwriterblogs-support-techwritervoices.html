Duration: 5 min.</p>
<p>This is just a brief 5 min. podcast to cover two special announcements. The first is that I've created a blog directory wiki called <a href="http://www.techwriterblogs.com" target="_blank" title="Tech Writer Blogs: Central Directory for the Tech Writing Blogosphere">www.techwriterblogs.com</a>. This is a central directory for all blogs related to technical writing. Please add your blog info (URL and feed) there so that others can find you. The second announcement is that we now have a way for you to help support equipment and bandwidth costs for Tech Writer Voices. Please help support the podcast with a small donation. Thanks.</p>
<p></p>
<p>12/23/2007 Update: Thanks for all the support.</p>
<p>More information about both of these announcements is on my blog.</p>
