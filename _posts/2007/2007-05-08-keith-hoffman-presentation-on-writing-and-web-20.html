<p>This is a presentation Keith Hoffman gave on writing and Web 2.0 at the University of Wisconsin a few months back. If you recall, Keith wrote the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stc.org/intercom/not.logged.in.asp" title="Writing and Web 2.0 article">feature article in January's Intercom</a> on Web 2.0. This podcast also has a video component, which you can <a target="_blank" href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=828489161369513884" title="Video recording of Keith's presentation">watch it here</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a little bit about Keith:</p>
<ul>
<li>He's the [soon-to-be past] president of the Madison Wisconsin STC chapter</li>
<li>He's now the president of a group called the Wisconsin Communicators Council.</li>
<li>He has a blog at <a href="http://twowrites.com" title="Keith's blog">http://twowrites.com</a>.</li>
<li>You can contact him at <a href="mailto:keith.hoffman@berbee.com">keith.hoffman@berbee.com</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that because this is a presentation, at times students ask questions and it's not really possible to hear their voices. Because of this, I've edited out or minimized some of these silence gaps. There are just a few of them. Overall this is a great podcast to listen to -- very informative and thought-provoking. Thanks for contributing it Keith!</p>
