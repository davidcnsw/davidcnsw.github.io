<p>I'll be attending and presenting at the <a href="http://www.doctrain.com/index.php/site/program/41/" title="Doc Train Conf." target="_blank">Doc Train Conference</a> in Vancouver, B.C. this Tuesday. Let me know if I'll see you there. I'm hoping to do a lot of blogging and podcasting from the conference, so keep your eyes on this blog and the <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com" title="Tech Writer Voices" target="_blank">Tech Writer Voices podcast</a>.</p>
