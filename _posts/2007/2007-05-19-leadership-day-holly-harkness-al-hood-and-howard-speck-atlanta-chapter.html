<p>I've been following Holly's blog for the past year, so it was great to finally meet her. In this short interview, Holly (outgoing Atlanta president), Al (incoming president), and Howard (newsletter guru) talk about retention strategies for members. They plan to interview ex-chapter members about why they didn't renew. They also talk about non-traditional meetings their chapter is having, such as software Saturdays and happy-hour meetings.</source></audio></p>
