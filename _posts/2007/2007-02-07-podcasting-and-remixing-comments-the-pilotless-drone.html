<p>I heard this on NPR the other day and it was in my head all day, so I decided to make a post about it. The San Francisco Chronicle allows voice comments on their articles, and an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=5&entry_id=12853">irate reader called up complaining</a> about redundant terminology used to describe pilotless aircrafts. The Chronicle plays the comments as mini-podcasts on their site. Someone remixed the pilotless drone comment into a catchy little tune that is now amassing thousands of hits on youtube. It's an example of Web 2.0 at its finest.</p>
