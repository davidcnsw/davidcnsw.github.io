<p>Rhevati shares what she's taking away from leadership day. To motivate others, you must participate in activities in beneficial ways. She also explains the challenges her chapter faces, such as balancing time and resources. She plans to mix in virtual activities with traditional activities. Her colleague, Wendy Tung, in the same chapter, says she's interested in emerging technologies and networking sessions.</source></audio></p>
