<p>Whitney is one of the authors of Content and Complexity: Information Design in Technical Communication. Whitney explains the five E's â€” a simple way to talk about product usability. The five E's are efficient, effective, engaging, error-tolerant, and easy to learn. She elaborates on what it means for a product to be engaging/satisfying. Whitney also explains the importance of personas, which she has written about in the Personas Lifecycle by Tamara Adline and John Pruit. Whitney says stories are essential to personas.
