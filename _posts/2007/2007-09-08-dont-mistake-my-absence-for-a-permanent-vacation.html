<p>It's been a while since my last post. Sure I've busy with the move and new job, but I've also just fallen out of the habit of blogging. I know blogging can be evidence of an active, engaged mind, so I don't ever want to give it up. Please don't mistake my absence for a permanent vacation. I'm just in transition right now and other things are on the forefront of my life.</p>
<p>So where has my mind been? I've been learning a lot about storage area networks and the like. Plus my days are on a different schedule (four 10 hour days). Within a month or so I'll settle back into the rhythm of things.</p>
<p>Same goes for the podcast. I like reaching out and interacting with people. I also miss the frequent comments and interaction from this blog.</p>
