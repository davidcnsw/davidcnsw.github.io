<p>Debbie's presentation on modular writing and reusability was attended by about 200 people. In her presentation, Debbie explained how to chunk content by first looking at different content types: procedures, processes, facts, principles, and so forth. She also mentions a tool called Content Mapper that writers can use to chunk and reuse information through Microsoft Word. A trial version of the DITA version of Content Mapper is available at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.infomap.com" title="Info Map">www.infomap.com</a>.</source></audio></p>
