<p>Upgrading WordPress is a pain -- backing up your database, downloading the latest zip file, deactivating plugins, deleting old files, uploading new files, running update scripts, reactivating plugins, etc. That's why when <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2007/10/wordpress-231/" target="_blank">non-major releases like 2.3.1</a> come around, I often look to see if upgrading is actually worthwhile.</p>
<p>All that has changed now. The <a href="http://techie-buzz.com/wordpress-plugins/wordpress-automatic-upgrade-plugin.html" title="WordPress Automatic Upgrade Plugin" target="_blank">WordPress Automatic Upgrade Plugin</a> performs all of the steps automatically, allowing you to upgrade your blog in about 5 clicks. This plugin won third prize in the recent <a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/pluginblog/2007/08/26/winners-wordpress-plugin-competition/" title="plugin contest" target="_blank">WordPress plugin contest</a>. I highly recommend it -- it will make your life easier.</p>
