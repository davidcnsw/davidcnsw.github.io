For a little background about why I started this course, see [Starting a new series on visual communication](https://idratherbewriting.com/2016/03/12/new-series-on-visual-communication/).

The content here is a draft in progress. I will be publishing about two new sections a week here for the next year. After I finish collecting the material, my second approach will be to organize it into a logical, coherent flow. Right now the topics and sequence are mostly random.
