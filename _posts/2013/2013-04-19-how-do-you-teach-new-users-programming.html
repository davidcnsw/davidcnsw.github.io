<p>I've recently fallen in love with a site called <a href="http://codeacademy.com">Code Academy</a>, which juxtaposes a real-time programming console with instructions and activities. It's the most hands-on, interactive site I've come across, and I want to someday model my own help to be like it.</p>
<p>Here are a few key points:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Users learn by doing. Each concept has an associated activity with it that reinforces the concept through the activity.</span></li>
<li>The concepts have to be somewhat simple and concrete in order to demonstrate them through a hands-on activity.</li>
<li>Implementing a similar site would require help from a programming team.</li>
<li>Similar to the Let Me Try simulations, if you don't program the code exactly as it should be, the system sometimes thinks you did it wrong.</li>
<li>The instructional column is somewhat limited in the depth it can cover. Sometimes I'd like to just read a few paragraphs or pages on the topic.</li>
</ul>
