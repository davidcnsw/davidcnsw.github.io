<p>I'm preparing for an upcoming presentation at a local STC chapter in the SF Bay area. I'm hoping to get some feedback before I finalize this presentation, so if you have some ideas, I'd love to hear from you. Here's my draft:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>Why Users Can't Find Answers to Their Questions in Help Content</strong></p>
<p>One of the main goals of help material is to help users find answers to their questions, but so often this doesn't happen. Users foray into the help muttering under their breath only to leave it cursing vocally afterwards -- because the help didn't answer their question, or at least the user couldn't find the answer. Why not? Why is it so hard to guide users to the right information when they need it? In this presentation, I'll list 20 reasons why users can't find answers in help, and then suggest meaningful ways to connect users to answers in help material.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's the extent of the description. Now here are my 20 reasons why users can't find their answers in help material. These answers are in the form of an interactive poll. I would like you to select the top reasons (make 5-10 selections or so) that you think are the main causes for which users can't find answers in help.</p>
<p>Your ratings will allow me to prioritize the answers to focus more on the core issues associated with help.<br />

1. The answer isn't in the help because the help only sticks with the obvious; advanced cases are too infrequent to be included.</p>
<p>2. The answer is in text form, but the user likes visuals and so skips over long text blocks and hence never finds the answer.</p>
<p>3. The answer is an isolated task, but the user needs a more connected beginning-to-end workflow for a process that involves multiple tasks in context of each other.</p>
<p>4. The user searches for the answer, but the help's poor SEO prevents the answer from surfacing in the top results (the answer is on page 4 of the results). Hence the user assumes the answer isn't there -- because Google always serves up the right results at the top, and never requires users to dig into additional pages. </p>
<p>5. The user is too lazy to search the help in a thorough enough way to find the answer. The user really just wants to say, "I looked in the help." No effort is given for a fair dig to unearth the answer.</p>
<p>6. The user looks in a "logical" place for the help topic and doesn't find it, and so concludes that the help topic doesn't exist. In reality, the topic can be categorized in a variety of different groupings and happens to be in another section.</p>
<p>7. The help uses terms unfamiliar to the user (e.g., "gizmo" instead of "widget"), so the user's searches never connect with the right answer.</p>
<p>8. The help has been fragmented and dispersed over many small topics such that the reader must proceed semi-linearly through book-like pages in order to understand the content, but it's not clear where the book pages begin or end. The help is a maze with no starting or ending point except page 1 and page 300.</p>
<p>9. The content is out of date or wrong, perhaps referring to a previous version. This is because there's no process for maintenance and evaluation of help content after it's published.</p>
<p>10. The help is written in an intimidating, formal language that users find off-putting and unfriendly. The conventions of help writing ("radio buttons," "users", "clear the check box," etc.) don't communicate clearly the user.</p>
<p>11. Users don't trust help material, so as soon as they experience any setback in the company's help (i.e., not finding the answer immediately with a quick search), they give up and turn to Google instead, only to come up short with searches there too.</p>
<p>12. The table contents in the help file is too massive to allow users to find anything, and the search feature in the help file is poor -- it returns hundreds of results.</p>
<p>13. The help is only available online but the user uses the product offline. The user tries to browse the help with a mobile device, but the help doesn't display well or even function on a  mobile device.</p>
<p>14. The help doesn't provide concrete examples that make the concepts understandable. Everything is left in the abstract, and code samples are abstracted with high-level references (like cb for "callback" or any actual callback function), so the content itself is just dense and fuzzy even though it's accurate and relevant.</p>
<p>15. The help is written for a user way beyond the level of the actual user. For example, a non-tech savvy user struggles to follow what are pretty much common conventions for anyone who is a digital native. </p>
<p>16. The user's question involves a feature not included in the application. The answer is in the help but appears only indirectly. For example, the help avoids describing what users can't do, assuming that users will it isn't possible if such an action or feature isn't listed in the help.</p>
<p>17. The help is written by an outside tech writer isolated from the business processes, environment, and questions of real users, so the help rarely contains the information users are looking for. </p>
<p>18. The user wants to read the a PDF version of the help to prop it up beside his or her computer, but only an online HTML version is available. Hence the user skips the help.</p>
<p>19. The user opens the help but is immediately intimidated by it because it's 600 pages long and looks like it will take an entire day to get through.</p>
<p>20. The answer is buried in a long page, but the user only spends about 2 minutes max on a page scanning for the answer -- hence the user rarely finds it.<br />
