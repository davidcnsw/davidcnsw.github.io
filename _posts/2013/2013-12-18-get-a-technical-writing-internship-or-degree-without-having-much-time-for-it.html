<p>A reader asks,</p>
<blockquote><p>I am a college student that is unsure of what I want to do when I "grow up." I previously thought that I wanted to work in human services, and although I still have the same drive to help those less fortunate I don't think that I want to make that my career.</p>
<p>Besides raising a child and taking care of the house, which I think is a full-time job on its own, I also work outside of the home (I get to my school work some time between serving dinner and falling asleep on the couch while watching Big Bang Theory re-runs).</p>
<p>Because of my hectic life, I don't have the option of traditional college classes or, more importantly, unpaid (hah!) internships. Not only do many college students find employment through internships, they also get on-the-job experience before committing to a specific degree or career. Lucky them, huh?</p>
<p>Basically what I am getting at is this: what kind of short-term internships or job shadowing opportunities are available for someone like me? Is there a contact (person, business, etc.) that you recommend? I live in Pennsylvania, about 1.5 hours from Philadelphia. I really appreciate your time and look forward to hearing from you.</p></blockquote>
<p>Educational programs and internships don't fit into everyone's schedule. Fortunately, you can break into technical writing without either of those things. See my series, <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/series/get-a-job-in-technical-writing/">Get a Job in Technical Writing: 7 Steps</a> for more details. Basically, here's what you mostly need to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Build a portfolio of technical writing samples.</li>
<li>Learn some tools and technologies that technical writers use.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although it may be hard, somehow you'll need to find the time to create some compelling writing samples. I recommend digging into an application you already know and writing sample help guides for it. If you're looking to learn a new project, try contributing to the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org">WordPress Codex</a>. Or if you like Drupal, create some good documentation for the Views or Taxonomy modules.</p>
<p>Second, re the tools and technologies, CSS, XML, HTML, DITA are all good to know. And for tools, maybe oXygen, some help authoring tool (e.g., Flare or Framemaker), graphics (Snagit, Illustrator), a video recording tool (Camtasia Studio), and others.</p>
<p>Finally, learn to self-learn. There are abundant resources online that you can leverage. The best technical writers pick up new tools and technologies on their own.</p>
<p>Re the time to do it all, if you can only devote an hour a day, chip away at building these skills over the course of a year or two. You'll be surprised at how it adds up. Use your weekends to do most of the work (if your weekdays are too busy).</p>
