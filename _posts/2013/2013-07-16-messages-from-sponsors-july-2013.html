The service functions online, without the need for any software installation. A user-friendly member area makes it easy to check texts, review results, and learn the website functionality.</p>
<p>PlagiarismDetect was founded in October 2007, after a team of dedicated programmers developed a unique algorithm based on one-of-a-kind SMART multi-layer technology. This technology allows you to find even the slightest matches all across the web. The main aim of the service is to assist the education sector and improve overall student integrity.</p>
<p>With PlagiarismDetect, you have two options to choose from: either Standard or Premium.

<h2>Southern Polytechnic State University (SPSU)</h2>
<p><em>Message by Laura Palmer, a professor at SPSU</em></p>
<p><strong>What's a Graduate Certificate and Why Would You Want One?</strong></p>
<p>I'm the first to admit that the term "certificate" always made me think about non-credit, continuing education. At one time, I'd taught in a certificate program offered by a major university. The courses were challenging, to say the least, and the program had a great reputation; however, no academic credit was available.</p>
<p>Until I came to SPSU as a faculty member, it had been ages since I thought about certificates. In my first week, I learned that the graduate program in Information Design and Communication offered five (FIVE!) different graduate certificate options. That number would—by way of demand and interest—grow to the six we have today.</p>
<p><strong>What's a grad certificate?</strong></p>
<p>That was my initial question, too! A graduate certificate is a credit-based program of study designed for individuals who already hold a bachelor's degree. The idea behind a grad certificate is really quite ingenious. Instead of taking a full master's degree with up to 36 credits including a thesis or qualifying exam, a graduate certificate uses a small core of existing grad courses to form a specialized area of study.</p>
<p>If a master's degree is the full 26.2-mile marathon, the graduate certificate is the 13.1-mile version.</p>
<p>In the Information Design and Communication program, our certificates are all 6-course offerings. However, the number of courses in a certificate varies between universities. As an example, the University of North Texas has a Certificate in Teaching Technical Writing offered through the Department of Linguistics and Technical Communication. Their certificate is a 4-course offering.</p>
<p><strong>What's the benefit?</strong></p>
<p>Time. Money. Those are the big benefits. It's much faster and more economical to go for a specialized certificate instead of a master's degree. But, let's not forget about personal needs and wants: a master's degree isn't for everybody. For lots of people, a graduate certificate can meet their career ambitions, including advancing in a current position or opening the door to one that's completely different.</p>
<p>Another benefit of a graduate certificate is when and how the courses are offered. Most certificates offer their courses at night for working adults. Some programs, like ours, offer courses fully online. With distance learning technologies, the commute is gone and the need to live near the institution leaves the equation.</p>
<p>Here's another benefit of a graduate certificate: recognition. Tackling four, five, or even six graduate level courses is no small feat; people understand you've taken on a comprehensive program. You also have the opportunity to be part of a community of scholars when you take classes. Yes, you'll learn about theory, but you'll also see where theory intersects with application.</p>
<p><strong>I'm new to Tech Comm. Is there an introductory graduate certificate?</strong></p>
<p>There most certainly is! We offer an introductory Graduate Certificate in Technical Communication—it's a great choice for people who don't have the disciplinary background or experience.</p>
<p><strong>An advanced graduate certificate?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we have those! We offer certificates specifically for people who already have a master's degree. Recently, we've broadened our admission criteria to include applicants with a master's degree from any accredited institution. This option is an excellent way to gain a value-added credential without taking on a doctoral program. Our advanced certificates include: User Experience, Visual Communication, Project Management, Content Strategy, and Instructional Design.</p>
<p>So, if you're thinking about more education, consider a graduate certificate. For information, please visit our <a href="http://www.spsu.edu/etcma/grad/prospective/program_options/index.htm">SPSU graduate program options page</a>.</p>
