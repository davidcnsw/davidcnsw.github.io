<p>Every so often I let my blog sponsors post a message to my readers. Below are brief messages from ScreenSteps, Adobe, 3vdia, Congility, Madcap Software, and MindTouch. Read this as if you were browsing a hall of  interesting vendors during a tech comm conference.</p>
<h2>ScreenSteps Desktop - Clearer Documentation in Less Time</h2>
<p>ScreenSteps  Desktop is the simplest and fastest way to create clearer software  documentation in less time. By integrating screen capture, image editing  and document authoring into a single application, ScreenSteps lets you  create crystal clear how-to documents in minutes instead of hours.  The  documents you create can be published to services such as MindTouch,  Confluence, WordPress, Joomla, Drupal and many other wiki, blog and  content management systems.</p>
<ul>
<li>Capture images using our integrated screen capture tools. As you capture images, your “how-to” document is assembled for you.</li>
<li>Annotate your images with arrows, boxes, circles and text boxes. Blur out sensitive information in screen captures.</li>
