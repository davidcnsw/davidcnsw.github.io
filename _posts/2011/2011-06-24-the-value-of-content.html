<p>For the past few weeks, I've been obsessed about building a technology blog for my organization. But this past week I had a sobering wake-up call that has made me rethink what types of content readers find valuable. It turns out, if you look at the metrics for the site, that the blog isn't hardly read at all. Instead, many people read the forums and help content.</p>
<p>Really? Yes, I think in comparing content value, an informative set of help topics is more valuable to a reader than an ephemeral blog post on a random topic.</p>
