<h2>Congree Personal Edition — The Easiest Way to Perfect Your Content</h2>
<p>Congree, Inc. is proud to announce the arrival of the Personal Edition of our critically acclaimed authoring assistance suite.  <a href="http://www.congree.com/en/congree-product.aspx">Congree Personal Edition</a> plugs directly into your favorite text editing programs, such as Microsoft Word and Just XMetaL, and turns them into fully fledged grammar, style, spelling, and punctuation checkers, using the most advanced checking technology on the market. Why spend hours double- and triple-checking your text to ensure it follows your client's style guide when Congree Personal Edition can do it for you automatically.  With Congree Personal Edition, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quickly and easily scan your documents, either as you write them or in a batch mode, for a wide variety of orthographical, stylistic, and grammar errors, and then correct those errors on the fly from within your favorite authoring program.</li>
<li>Conform your text to a variety of custom style guides, including Simplified English and Rule-Based Technical English, to ensure that your client gets the tone and complexity level that he desires. Congree Personal Edition can also ensure that text is translation friendly from the first word to the last, saving time and money on translation and administration costs.</li>
<li>Maximize your time and money, and free yourself up to do more work, by letting Congree Personal Edition handle the “grunt work” of writing, and letting you focus on the important and creative points. Congree plugs directly into whatever your favorite authoring tool is, so you can work directly in whatever environment to which you are accustomed.</li>
