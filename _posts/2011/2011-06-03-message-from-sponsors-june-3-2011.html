<h2>MadCap Software's MadPak ML Helps Companies Publish Content to Multiple Channels in Multiple Languages</h2>
<p>Using MadCap's integrated technical communications and translation product suite — <a href="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/products/madpakml/overview.aspx">MadPak ML</a> — authors can create content utilizing single-source functionality in Flare to publish directly to multiple outputs, including print, WebHelp, WebHelp for the iPad, mobile devices, and much more.  You no longer need more than one tool for print and online documentation. Single-sourcing in Flare allows documentation teams to save time and resources, such as being able to create custom content quickly and easily.  “Custom content is no longer burdensome, and when we edit a PDF, that edit is reflected in the WebHelp. That's a wonderful change from our old manual process,” said one customer.  Updating content is also easier.  “It's incredible how much faster it is to produce and update documentation using conditional text and snippets in Flare—and so much easier to ensure that this content is accurate and consistent.”</p>
<p>With Flare's native mobile output, content is frameless making it easily searchable using any popular search engine.  Mobile content published using Flare is also device-agnostic, allowing end-users to view content on any device, including Android phones, iPhones and the iPad.  “From using Web analytics, we discovered that many of our customers access our online product and support pages by doing a Google search,” explained a customer. “We took advantage of Flare's frameless mobile output and adapted it for our core WebHelp, which now can be easily searched from within Flare or using any popular search engine.”</p>
<p>Included in the suite is MadCap Lingo, a stand-along translation environment tool (TEnT) that can be used to translate content to any number of languages.  The tight integration with MadCap Flare makes the translation process easier and more efficient. “In the past, we had different files for each language, which were difficult to maintain,” one customer recalls. “With MadCap Lingo and Flare, we only have to maintain one central project. It's a much better process.”</p>
<p>MadPak ML also includes <a href="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/products/contributor/overview.aspx">MadCap Contributor</a> for SME contribution and review, which makes it easy for anyone in your organization to edit and review topics, make annotations, and update content with a simple, easy-to-use interface.
