<p>I started a new job last Monday at a company called <a href="http://www.the41.com/">The 41st Parameter</a> in San Jose. I'm pretty excited about it. 41st's main product helps prevent online fraud with transactions; another product helps with identity resolution for advertising technologies. </p>
<p>I'll be creating developer documentation for products that include C++, Java, .NET, and REST. I'll also probably be using Confluence. I'm one of 3 writers, but 2 are based on Arizona, where the company's parent company, Experian, is located.</p>
<p>If I'm not posting here as frequently as usual, it's because I have my nose buried in programming books. I have so much to learn, but I know I'm a perfect fit for this job.</p>
<p>By the way, speaking of books, if you haven't listened to Daniel Suarez's <i>Daemon</i>, it's a great read/listen. </p>
<p>One great thing about this job is that it's just 3 miles from my house. I love not having a commute. At the end of the day, I still have a lot of energy left.</p>
