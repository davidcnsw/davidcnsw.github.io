<p>I'm trying to gather more information about common practices with API documentation. I created an informal, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FYjPsjOcUws7vsJ_IV1G7huauiOT5cS1GmZqVBOf2lQ/">open survey about API Doc here</a>.</p>
<p>It's an openly editable Google Doc with about 10 questions. You can see others' responses as you enter your own.</p>
<p>If you do any kind of API documentation, I need your participation in the survey. This will allow me to better generalize common practices with API documentation in preparation for some upcoming presentations and blog posts.</p>
<p>I made it open so you can read the existing responses. I chose to use a short-answer response format because practices with API documentation vary so widely -- one practice often varies from another, and they can't easily be captured with simple radio button responses.</p>
<p>I'm hoping to get 25 responses so that I have a decent enough sample size. Right now I have about 10 responses. Basically, when I give some API doc presentations and someone asks me a question like, "Do developers expect you to learn everything from reading the source code files alone?" I want to provide a realistic answer that extends beyond the scope of my own experience.</p>
<p>Again, here's the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FYjPsjOcUws7vsJ_IV1G7huauiOT5cS1GmZqVBOf2lQ/">link to my API Documentation survey</a>. Thanks.</p>
