During my latest presentation on trends (at SCCI last month), I noted the somewhat startling fact that software developers seem to be growing at a rate about six times that of technical writers. If you look at the Bureau of Labor Statistics for these two categories, the trends look like this:

Technical writers

2010: 49,500
2012: 49,500
2014: 52,000
2016: 52,400


Software developers
2016: 1,256,200
2014: 1,114,000
2012: 1,018,000
2010: 913,000

Between 2010 to 2016, software developer jobs grew 37.5%, whereas technical writer jobs grew by 6%. 76% of technical writers agree that the number of engineers they support seems to be growing.

In response, some of the conference participants said the low growth rate for technical writers might be explained by these factors:

* More diverse job titles for technical writers
* Increases in offshoring of technical writers
* User-generated content supplanting the need for technical writers


## More diverse job titles for technical writers

Could it be that professionals with job titles such as information developer, content strategist, content developer, technical communicator, documentation specialist, programming writer, and other variations of technical writer are excluded from the BLS's collection of data?

To this point, the STC Salary Database report says the following:

> The compensation data used in this report were obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (www.bls.gov), a unit of the United States Department of Labor. The Bureau of Labor Statistics conducts the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) survey, a semi-annual survey focusing on employment levels and wages of more than 1,000 occupations. To
ensure relevant results for benchmarking, the survey does not include anyone identified as self-employed, owners or partners in unincorporated firms, household workers, or unpaid
family workers. The data provided from the OES were collected from a sample of approximately 1.2 million nonfarm establishments nationwide.
>
> To maintain the integrity of the data, questionnaires are regularly completed by human resources personnel. The survey requests information on the number of employees and the
wages for each employee within an occupation. Additionally, respondents to the survey are given occupational descriptions for each occupation type. This is done to ensure
employees are appropriately slotted into the correct occupation, as job titles often vary widely from company to company. These occupation descriptions are provided by the
Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system, a United States government system of classifying occupations.

I reached out to Writing Assistance, on of the sponsors of the report who also supplied a lot of the explanation and guidance for interpreting the information. They said ...


> Changes in the way the data are collected In the past, employment in some occupations in an industry may have been reported in a residual category rather than in the specific occupation. In order to limit the length of most survey forms to 24 pages, the forms list only the occupations that are likely to be found in the employer's industry. Prior to 2001, if an employer had an occupation that was not included on the form, the respondent may have reported the worker in an "all other" or residual category or in a related occupation. Currently, the employer is asked to report detailed occupational information for workers that cannot be placed in one of the occupations listed on the form on a separate page. This change may have the effect of showing increased employment in occupations not on the form for a particular industry. In addition, changes to the occupations listed on forms may cause employers to classify workers differently. [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.bls.gov/oes/oes_ques.htm#qf1)

## Increases in offshoring of technical writers

The second objection is that perhaps more technical writers have been employed from offshore locations. Since the BLS restricts its scope to the U.S. only, this could account for the meager job growth numbers.

Has offshoring steadily been increasing for the past 6 years? Where can I find this information?

## User-generated content supplanting the need for technical writers

Finally, what about all the user-generated content through YouTube and other sites, easily findable by Google. Couldn't this user-generated content perhaps offset the need for professional technical writers?
