Writing exercise for tech writing candidates

Describe a technical task or concept within 400-800 words. You can choose any topic, but consider selecting a topic related to the list of technical skills on your resume. For example, if you listed JavaScript, you might provide a tutorial on how to do a particular task in JavaScript (e.g., make a web request), or articulate a concept (e.g., asynchronous callbacks). You could also focus more on tools or hardware, such as how to perform a task in an application (e.g., reflection in Illustrator), or connecting a computer to a device (adb with tablets) for testing.

In your writing, follow best practices and conventions for technical documentation. For example, use plain language, structured headings, and numbered steps. If possible, reviewers might try to walk through your steps (if applicable) to see if they can follow them. The complexity of the task will be considered in the evaluation of the sample. You can use any format for authoring (e.g., Word, Markdown), as long as you can render it as a PDF.
