> Just as doc-as-code tools mirror tools used by software implementation teams, work processes that tech writers follow can also mirror processes used by software implementation teams. The most common software development methodology today is probably agile scrum.
>
> Although agile scrum is both loved and hated by engineers, and nearly everyone modifies their implementation of it, this methodology has resonance with engineers because so many engineering groups loosely follow the same agile scrum process. Agile scrum is an extremely common approach within the software development industry. When tech writers adopt a similar methodology, engineers they’re working with better understand the tech writer’s processes and workflows.

> At the end of the article, there’s a [short survey](/learnapidoc/pubapis_agile_scrum_for_docs.html#short_survey) to gather your thoughts and feedback.
