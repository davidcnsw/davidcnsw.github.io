description: "In this episode of the <a href='https://podcast.writethedocs.org'>Write the Docs podcast</a>, rather than the usual roundtable discussion, we provide a recording of a <a href='https://www.meetup.com/Write-The-Docs-Berlin/'>WTD Berlin</a> presentation by Lucie Le Naour on how to write inclusive tech documentation. Inclusive documentation takes into account all users, regardless of their gender, culture, or abilities. It uses language that treats different types of people fairly and equally, acknowledging that the words you choose matter in the connotations and attitudes they convey. This presentation was recorded on August 19, 2019 in Berlin."
