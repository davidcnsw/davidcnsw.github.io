<p>I've discovered two new blogs that I think are definitely worthwhile to add to your Google Reader:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first is <a href="http://www.helpscribe.com">Helpscribe</a>, by <a href="http://www.helpscribe.com/2008/02/about-craig-haiss.html">Craig Haiss</a>. He seems to have good common sense and I enjoy reading his perspective. His content is very focused on help authoring.</li>
<li>The second blog is <a href="http://madcapsoftware.wordpress.com/">Sharon's Madcap Blog</a>, by Sharon Burton. She's an intelligent, experienced writer who has recently joined Madcap Software and is a project manager for Blaze.</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, there are more blogs on my blogroll here: <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/blogroll" target="_blank">https://idratherbewriting.com/blogroll</a>. And if you're a help author with a blog, but you aren't on my blogroll, please <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/contact">let me know</a> so I can add you.</p>
