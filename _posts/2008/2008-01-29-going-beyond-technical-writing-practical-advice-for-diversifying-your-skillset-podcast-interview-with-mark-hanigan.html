<p>In this podcast, I talk with Mark Hanigan, former international STC president, about ways to go beyond technical writing. I knew Mark at the STC-Suncoast chapter in Florida and often, during "post-meeting-meetings," listened to him talk about ways to transition from technical writing into tasks that companies perceive as having higher value, such as business analysis and project management.</p>
<p>Mark strongly believes that technical writers often sell themselves short. Given our skill set, our attention to detail, and our comprehensive understanding of the applications we document, we become de facto SMEs who can deliver more than just a software manual. We can create business requirements, contribute UML diagrams representing workflows and processes, create computer-based training, influence business methodologies, implement content management strategies, present training and e-learning courses to users, help meet regulatory standards, and more.</p>
<p>In many companies, writers who stick with writing-only tasks quickly become outdated, as IT departments begin to perceive documentation as a commodity that can be outsourced. Mark talks about ways to diversify your skillset, wear many hats, and bring more value to the company.</p>
<p>He also talks about the essential quality that technical writers must have today: an ability to embrace change, to adapt and learn new technologies. This is, he explains, one reason for his abiding involvement in the <a href="http://stc.org" target="_blank">STC</a>: instantaneous access to colleagues who share information about the latest tools and technologies they're using.</p>
