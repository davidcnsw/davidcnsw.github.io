<p>Guy Kawasaki writes, "A PowerPoint presentation should have ten slides, last no more than twenty minutes, and contain no font smaller than thirty points" (<a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2005/12/the_102030_rule.html">The 10/20/30 Rule of Powerpoint</a>). I wish everyone who prepares a presentation would follow this advice. Long PowerPoints disrupt any kind of narrative flow and dynamic energy that can build up when you deliver your message.</p>
