<p>We started a blog for Sally last week. The URL is <a href="http://theordinaryprincess.com">theordinaryprincess.com</a>. So far she's been excited about it, although one day she did ask me why we blog. It's funny, because Shannon and I both blog fairly regularly. Now Sally blogs too. Just today she was complaining that Mom didn't help her on the computer and she didn't get to write her post for the day. Seven years old, and already concerned that she didn't get to write her daily post!</p>
<p>I think a blog can be a tremendous tool for teaching kids to write. Sally enjoys writing and getting comments, as well as participating in the same activities as Mom and Dad. We are strangely becoming a blogging family. We've always been writers, and now Sally is showing to be a real bookworm, just like Shannon. Man, if I had been introduced to blogging at the age of seven, how would that have changed my life?</p>
<p>Jane uses pseudonyms for our family, so I've decided to do the same.Â  At first I really hated being called Dick. Now I think it's funny. It provides some distance between reality and the written word, and it reminds me that what we write is a construct of how we perceive reality, rather than how reality actually may be.</p>
<p>To be consistent, and as a companion to Jane's blog, <a href="https://seagullfountainblog.wordpress.com">seagullfountain.com</a>, I've adopted the same pseudonyms.</p>
