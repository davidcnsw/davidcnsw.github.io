<p>In this podcast, I interview Bogo Vatovec, an expert in change management, user experience, and knowledge engineering, about the technical writer's role in interface design. Specifically, we cover the following in the podcast:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>What the technical writer's role should be in the company</li>
<li>Why the technical writer's skills are often "accepted but not respected"</li>
<li>Why a technical writer needs to do more than just what he or she is told </li>
<li>What the technical writer's role is in relation to design and usability</li>
<li>The importance of spinning your criticisms of prototypes in positive ways</li>
<li>How early the technical writer should get involved with a project</li>
<li>The semantics and implications of names ("technical writer" versus "information designer")</li>
<li>How the role of an information designer differs from the role of a technical writer</li>
<li>Why changing the name from "writer" to some other title isn't enough</li>
<li>Why writing skills are a declining value</li>
<li>What happens when writers do more</li>
</ul>
<p>Bogo is a senior member of the STC and a regular presenter at conferences worldwide. For example, at the last STC Summit, Bogo participated in a panel on career trends.</p>
