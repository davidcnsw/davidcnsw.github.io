<p>On the Technical Writers of India listserv, someone is trying to get his company to realize the value of technical communication by showing a humorous video on bad documentation that he can use during training. "The idea is to evoke laughter, and keep the audience engaged throughout my presentation."</p>
<p>Okay, hands-down, this is the best video to show. Hat tip to <a href="http://dontcallmetina.wordpress.com/2008/08/04/why-we-need-technical-communicators/">Holly Harkness</a> and Karen Shriver for finding this.</p>
