<p>Paul Pehrson, a Utah-based technical writer who blogs at <a href="http://blog.paulpehrson.com/" target="_blank">Technically Speaking</a>, writes,</p>
<blockquote><p>I've been invited to speak at the DITA Tech/Comm Conference at the beginning of next month. I've got a free conference registration I'd like to give away, and I wondered if you'd like to give it away on your blog. (I don't think I get enough traffic on my blog for that.) ... It's a full 4-day registration, with a retail value of $795 dollars.</p></blockquote>
<p>Do you need a free ticket to the DITA Tech/Comm Conference in North Carolina this November 3-6? Check out <a href="http://www.brightpathsolutions.com/pages/conf/tc08/index.html" target="_blank">the conference website</a> for details.</p>
<p>Paul has only one free ticket. If you want it, leave a comment below this post with your most creative rendition of what DITA might alternatively stand for (other than Darwin Information Typing Architecture). On Monday morning, I'll pick the winner -- based completely on my subjective judgment about which DITA re-acronym I like best.</p>

<p>Paul also adds,</p>
<blockquote><p>Anybody who wants to attend the conference, can get $50 off the price of registration by using my name "<strong>Paul Pehrson</strong>" as their discount code on the conference registration page.</p></blockquote>
<p>By the way, if anyone else has free conference tickets, products, or other services they want to give away through my site, let me know.</p>
