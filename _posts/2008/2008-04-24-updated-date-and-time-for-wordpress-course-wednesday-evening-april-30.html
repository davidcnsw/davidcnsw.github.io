<p>I updated the date and time for the WordPress course. Instead of this Saturday, I've moved it to next Wednesday evening. Here are the updated details:</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Wednesday, April 30<br />
<strong>Time:</strong> 7:30 p.m. CST<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> Web<br />
<strong>Cost:</strong> $99<br />
<strong>Course Size: </strong>Limited to 15 participants</p>
<p>I hope this can better accommodate all of you who emailed me to say that you have previous engagements this Saturday. If not, I'm sure I'll do some more training in the future.</p>
<p>For more details about what the training will cover and how to sign up, see <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/wordpress">WordPress for Beginners Course</a>.</p>
