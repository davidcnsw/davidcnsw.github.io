<p>The Help Authoring Tools survey in my blog's sidebar has been the source of no little controversy, and I've left it up there for a reason. I've been telling myself that when 1,000 people participate, I'll officially analyze the results. (So far 784 have voted.)</p>
<p>However, <a href="http://helpstuff.com/blog/index.php/2008/09/08/authoring_tool_survey_now_posted" target="_blank">Char James-Tanny announced</a> a new help authoring tools survey, this one sponsored by the <a href="http://hat-matrix.com/" target="_blank">HAT-Matrix</a> (not to be confused with the Matrix movie). The new HAT-Matrix's survey is a little more official looking. Perhaps the creators have taken into account all of the slippery variables that lead to survey bias.</p>
<p>So I ask you to please take a minute and <a href="http://is.gd/2mx8" target="_blank">fill out the help authoring tools survey</a> published by the HAT-Matrix. I'm really curious to know if the survey in my blog's sidebar is bogus or if it carries any weight. The HAT-Matrix's help authoring tools survey will be available until the end of September 2008.</p>
