<p><a href="http://techsmith.com" target="_blank">TechSmith</a> (the creators of Camtasia Studio, SnagIt, and other tools) has the best free tech support I've ever seen. I submitted a question yesterday about reducing file size in Camtasia Studio, and today I received a screencast reply from one of the TechSmith staff. He wrote,</p>
<blockquote><p>Thanks!  Here's a few answers to your questions:</p>
<p><a href="http://screencast.com/t/QNIh41u4" target="_blank">http://screencast.com/t<wbr></wbr>/QNIh41u4</a></p></blockquote>
<p>I was blown away by the screencast reply. I bet the time it takes to create a short video and share it with Jing is probably less than it would take to write it out.</p>
<p>By the way, do you use <a href="http://www.jingproject.com/" target="_blank">Jing</a> for anything like this? If so, I'm curious to know how you're using it.</p>
