<p>Are you interested in going to <a href="http://doctrain.com/east" target="_blank">Doc Train East</a> in Massachusetts at the end of October? <del datetime="2008-09-26T17:18:27+00:00">I have a free ticket that Scott Abel allowed me to give to one of the readers of my blog. If you're interested, send me an email at tomjoht@gmail.com.</del> <strong>Update: </strong>Lots of responses this morning -- thanks. I've now given it away. Actually, I ended up giving away about 10.</p>
