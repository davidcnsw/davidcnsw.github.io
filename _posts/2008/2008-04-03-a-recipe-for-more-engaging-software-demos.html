<p>This is a funny video of <a href="http://chris.pirillo.com/2008/03/20/how-do-you-teach-people-about-hardware-and-software/">Chris Pirillo</a> talking about how difficult it is to teach people software.</p>

<p>In software training sessions I've given recently, I've learned that demos can be incredibly boring unless you do them in a certain way. People don't learn much by simply watching you click through everything and explain tabs and buttons. People learn by doing, so you have to get them doing something. </p>
<p>Here's my recipe, recommended by <a href="http://pr10n.livejournal.com/">a friend</a>, for delivering more engaging software demos. (This assumes you're in a computer lab).</p>
<ul>
<li>Show a few of the most common tasks one can do with the software. 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Give a list of 5-7 tasks (not too hard) for users to complete. While they work on the tasks, walk around and help them out individually. 15 min.</li>
<li>As a group, walk through how to do each exercise. 10 min.</li>
<li>Answer miscellaneous questions. 10 min.</li>
</ul>
<p>People like to be challenged with exercises -- that's the key. Even if you haven't shown them how to do the task, that's okay. Let them try to figure it out.</p>
<p>Also, make sure you invite your interaction designer to come and watch people stumble around the application.</p>
<p>What tips and techniques do you use to keep people engaged while giving software demos?</p>
