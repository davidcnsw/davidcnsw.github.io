<p>A strange thing happens when you take an audio file of someone speaking and set it to music -- the two separate tracks combine such that the result is greater than the sum of the parts. For example, listen to the 3 minute track below that combines a 1981 speech by Shakespearean English scholar <a href="http://www.ldsvoices.com/index.php?id=977">Arthur Henry King</a> with <a href="http://mysteriousuniverse.org/2008/04/12/episode-93-mu-music/#more-2121">Kiln's Fyrepond</a>.</p>
<p><audio controls><source src="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3?https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/podcasts/diglossia.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></p>
<p>I have not altered either track in any way. I simply layered them together. Listening to both the speech and music brought together this way gives more depth to both.</source></audio></p>
