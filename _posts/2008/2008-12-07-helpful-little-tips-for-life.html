<p>Today I bring you a random compilation of helpful little tips -- for work, for home, or for dealing with kids, etc. -- that I've learned in life.</p>
<ol>
<li>If you're <strong>tired at work</strong>, rotate tasks on the half hour to stay productive.</li>
<li>If you want to <strong>save money on toys</strong>, take your kids to a thrift store and let each child choose his or her own toy.</li>
<li>If your <strong>bath tub drains slowly</strong>, remove the plug and use a bent coat hook to pull out the endless hair that's stopping it up.</li>
<li>If your <strong>kid is having trouble riding a bike</strong>, remove the pedals, lower the seat, and let the kid scuttle along until he or she is ready for the pedals again.</li>
<li>If your <strong>kids act like hooligans in stores</strong>, get a small umbrella stroller and let one of the kids push another kid (it keeps them occupied a bit more).</li>
<li>If you <strong>need better sleep at night</strong>, turn off all sources of light (light prolongs the body's circadian rhythm) and sleep in total darkness.</li>
<li>If your <strong>kids resist having their teeth brushed</strong>,<strong> </strong>brush in the rhythm of a song (e.g., "monkeys up, monkeys down, monkeys left ...").</li>
<li>If you <strong>dread folding immense piles of laundry</strong>, pop in headphones and listen to a podcast while folding.</li>
<li>If you <strong>lose your cell phone</strong>, call it with Skype.</li>
<li>If you <strong>have writer's block</strong>, immerse yourself in information from books, listservs, RSS feeds, and presentations.</li>
</ol>
<p>And one bonus tip: If something is hard to do, do it every day.</p>
