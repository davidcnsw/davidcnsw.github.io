<p>In this podcast, I talk with <a href="http://thecontentwrangler.com">Scott Abel</a> about social networking, in particular The Content Wrangler community he started at <a href="http://thecontentwrangler.ning.com">TheContentWrangler.ning.com</a>. Scott talks about this new social network specifically for technical communicators. But he also explains the value of social networks for your help deliverables. Social networks can help users connect with one another and also help technical communicators better understand their users.<br />
