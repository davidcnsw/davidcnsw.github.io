<blockquote><p>Dear Mr. Tom Johnson,</p>

<p>Dear K,</p>
<p>The best thing you can do to develop your skills and ability with technical writing is to actually do some technical writing. Find an open source project, such as <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Main_Page">WordPress.org</a> or <a href="http://forums.pligg.com/general-help/1630-basic-users-guide.html">Pligg</a>, and write some documentation for it. Most open source projects have poor documentation, so they provide excellent opportunities.</p>
<p>When you finish your user guide or online help, ask someone on a technical writing listserv (like TECHWR-L) to review it. Someone will probably give you excellent feedback. Make a few updates, polish it up, and use it as the technical writing sample in your portfolio. Nothing gets you more familiar with technical writing than actually doing technical writing.</p>
<p>Tom</p>
