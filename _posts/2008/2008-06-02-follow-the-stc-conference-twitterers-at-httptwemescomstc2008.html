<p><a href="http://twemes.com">Twemes.com</a> is a service that aggregates tweets that have the same tag. A handful of twitterers at the STC Conference are tagging their tweets with <strong>#stc2008</strong>. If you go to <a href="http://twemes.com/stc2008">http://twemes.com/stc2008</a>, you can see a stream of all of these tweets.</p>
<p>Right now the number of people on Twitter at this conference is abysmally low (less than 1%), but through one co-twitterer we were able to lower the AC in a room. It's a start.</p>
<p>If you're tweets have anything to do with the conference, just insert the #stc2008 tag in the tweet and Twemes will grab it.</p>
