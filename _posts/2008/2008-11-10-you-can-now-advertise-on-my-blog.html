<p>If you look in the sidebar of my site, you'll see that I've enlarged the space and included two placeholder ads. I intentionally cleared this space to make way for companies to promote their products and services.</p>
<p>I'd Rather Be Writing receives approximately 1200 page views a day from technical communicators all over the world. 1500 people are subscribed to the feed alone, making it one of the most popular technical writing blogs on the Internet. (1500 people is 200 more people than the entire attendance at the last STC Summit.)</p>
<p>The audience for I'd Rather Be Writing is completely global in scope. For example, today Paul Pehrson, in Saudi Arabia right now training people on Flare, told me one of his Saudi students asked if he knows the "I'd Rather Be Writing guy." I regularly receive comments from people in the United Kingdom, Malaysia, India, Canada, Australia, and Germany -- many of whom are outside the main advertising venues of other U.S. conferences and publications. </p>
<p>I've purposely waited to allow advertising on my site until I had a sizable audience to make it worthwhile. There are six major advertising spots above the fold, and a larger number of spots below the fold. If you're interested in getting more visibility for your company -- approximately 36,000 impressions each month -- then <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/advertising/">sign up quickly</a> before the advertising spots are gone.</p>
<p>For readers of my blog who may be concerned that advertising will water down my opinions and make me less likely to voice criticisms of sponsoring companies, don't worry. I will continue to publish the perspectives I hold. One of the strengths of this blog is its independent voice. (Companies should realize that advertising in my sidebar does not guarantee immunity from criticism.)</p>
<p>I hope to fill the sidebar completely within the next two weeks. If you're interested in buying advertising, please see my <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/advertising/">Advertising page</a> for details. If you have any questions, you can contact me at tomjoht@gmail.com (or any other method listed on my <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/contact">Contact</a> page).</p>
