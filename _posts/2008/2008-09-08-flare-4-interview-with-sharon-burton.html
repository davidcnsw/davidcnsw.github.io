<p>Flare 4 was just released today by <a href="http://madcapsoftware.com">Madcap Software</a>. In this podcast, I talk with Sharon Burton -- product manager at Madcap Software -- about all the main features of the Flare 4 release.</p>
<p>Flare 4 topics we discuss include the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Page layouts</li>
<li>New outputs (PDF, XPS, XHTML, and Adobe Air)</li>
<li>Enhanced reporting capability</li>
<li>Built-in topic reviews</li>
<li>Additional help guides</li>
<li>Global project linking</li>
<li>Image resizing</li>
<li>Smart cross-references</li>
<li>Mini-TOCs for print</li>
</ul>
<p>Although Flare 4 is the core focus of this podcast, Sharon also explains a little about Madcap's other new releases, including Blaze, X-Edit, and Analyzer.</p>
<p>As if releasing 4 new products (Flare 4, Blaze, Analyzer, and X-Edit) on one day wasn't enough, Madcap also <a href="http://madcapsoftware.com" target="_blank">totally redesigned its website</a>.</p>
