<p>I occasionally write for <a href="http://tech.lds.org" target="_blank">LDS Tech</a>, a blog/forum site for the LDS Church's IT department, where I work. My latest article is titled "<a href="http://tech.lds.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=375&amp;Itemid=1" target="_blank">Twitter and LDS General Conference</a>." Here's an excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>When participants add hashtags to their tweets, such as #ldsconf, Twitter enables a community of people to gather virtually during an event. Through the hashtag, you can connect to a community of all other twitterers adding the same hashtags in their tweets, regardless of whether you're following them or whether they're following you.</p></blockquote>
