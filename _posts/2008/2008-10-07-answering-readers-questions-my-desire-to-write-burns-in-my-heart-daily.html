<blockquote>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>My name is Hannah, and I live in San Antonio, Texas.  I found your web site when I typed technical writing in google.com.  You have a beautiful family.</p>
<p>I am a part-time Accountant for a non-profit organization.  I do not enjoy accounting and the desire to write has always been a part of my soul.  My desire to write burns in my heart daily.  The part-time accounting position pays the bills, however I need to find a way to obtain a writing position in order to fulfill my desire, and help my husband keep a roof over our heads.  Do you have any suggestions of where a bored, hungry to write accountant can find work writing? I am also looking for a way to work from home.  Currently, I work from home one day per week, and the other 3 days on site.  Do you think you could help me?</p>
<p>Thank you for your time, and I hope to hear from you soon.</p>
<p>Have a great weekend!</p></blockquote>
<p>Hannah,</p>
<p>Thanks for writing. You can make a better living as an accountant (but for a for-profit company) than as a writer. If you have a creative drive, start a blog and write at nights. When you make a living as a professional writer, you often write about things you don't enjoy writing about. For example, you might write press releases about protein vitamins, or software manuals for products you would never use yourself.</p>
<p>If you go to WordPress.com, you can start a blog for free and write about whatever you want. It will cure your itch to write without putting you into the poverty house for lack of income. You might also try to harness your accounting expertise and write help material for accounting software.</p>
