<p>Several people have asked if I have a list of all the podcasts I've published (rather than having to page through the archives). I just added a comprehensive list below the Tech Writer Voices graphic on the right sidebar. Click the <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/category-podcasts/">See all episodes</a> link.</p>
<p>(By the way, I created that page by inserting the loop on a page template, stripping out the content tag, limiting the category to the Tech Writer Voices, and expanding the display count to 200.)</p>
<p>While I was updating that sidebar podcasts section, I also added a <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2008/08/21/how-to-listen-to-podcasts/" target="_blank">How to listen</a> link for people new to podcasting.</p>
