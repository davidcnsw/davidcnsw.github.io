<p>Many content management projects fail because organizations are either too focused on tools before properly researching their needs and processes, or because they underestimate the difficulty of migrating and restructuring their content to fit the new content management system.</p>
<p>In this podcast, Rahel Bailie explains these pitfalls and what companies can do to avoid them, as well as how companies can climb out of problems they're currently in. Rahel also talks about how technical communicators can influence business executives and other key stakeholders to make better decisions about content management.</p>
<p>For more information, see Rahel's website at <a href="http://www.intentionaldesign.ca/">intentionaldesign.ca</a>. Rahel is also organizing the next Content, Convergence Conference, &amp; Integration Conference in Vancouver, which is scheduled for September 2009.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I interviewed Rahel at the Doc Train 2008 conference in Vancouver.</source></audio></p>
