<p>Find a way to have fun with what you're writing. If you don't, not only will it be a miserable experience, the product will lack the energy, playfulness, and good feeling it needs to be successful. Change your point of view, experiment, try something different -- until the routine becomes an exploration, and the monotonous becomes your musing.</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, try reading a few <a href="http://icanhascheezburger.com">lolcats</a> to lighten things up.</p>
