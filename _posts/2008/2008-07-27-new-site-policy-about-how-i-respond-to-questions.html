<p>I get a lot of questions from readers who stumble upon my blog while searching for answers to various things. I don't mind getting questions, but a lot of times I don't have good answers. I've decided to add a new question policy to <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/contact" target="_self">my Contact page</a>. The policy is as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Note: </strong>If you ask me a question, I may choose to excerpt your question and post the response on my blog. When I do this, I'll always protect your identity with a fictional name. If you don't want me to respond to your question in a blog post, let me know. Posting responses via blog posts gives you a much larger audience to potentially respond to your question.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Most people are agreeable to this anyway, as long as I hide their identity. By posting the policy note before people submit questions, I can decrease the turnaround time, because I won't have to first reply with a request to post the response in a blog post.</p>
