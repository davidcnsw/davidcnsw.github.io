<p>Although some feel the name of your tech writing department doesn't matter a whole lot (for example, <a href="http://twitter.com/texaswriter/statuses/1037057531" target="_blank">TexasWriter</a> says "Find out what people now call it. Ask what they mean by it. If it's accurate, use it. You aren't marketing, don't make it up"), actually your department's name <em>does </em>have an impact on the role you're expected to play.</p>
<p>For example, our current department's name is "User Education." Because of this, every time a user has a how-to question about the application, they send the user to me <em>to</em> <em>be educated</em>. It would not be so, I believe, if our department name were different.</p>
<p>Lately I've been having conversations with a QA guy as I carpool to work. We've been talking about roles. Because I am a "technical writer," he wonders why I feel I should comment on software prototypes, or interact with users. "You're a W-R-I-T-E-R," he says. "You shouldn't be interfacing with the customer. That would be overlapping other people's jobs. You should be <em>writing </em>help material. That's what writers do."</p>
<p>People make decisions all the time based on connotations of job titles and department names. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>A user needs help with the application. Who should he call? "User Education" or "Information Design"?</li>
<li>You're setting up a meeting to evaluate prototypes. Who should be included? "User Information Development" or "Technical Publications"?</li>
<li>You need to develop some e-learning materials for training. Who should you call? "Learning Support" or "Strategic Communications and Media"?</li>
</ul>
<p>In each case, I bet you leaned toward the first option. Your department's name does affect how others perceive the role of your department. I guarantee you will be asked to provide more user training and support with a name like "User Assistance" than "Communication Strategy and Design."</p>
<p>Given the importance of choosing a department name, here are some options. Many of these were sent to me by tech writers over Twitter. Others I pulled from the archives of the Techwr-l listserv.</p>
<ul>
<li>Information Design</li>
<li>Information Development</li>
<li>Learning Support</li>
<li>Technical Publications</li>
<li>Technical Publications Office</li>
<li>Technical Communications</li>
<li>Training and Publications</li>
<li>Design and Development</li>
<li>User Information Development</li>
<li>Technical Information Development</li>
<li>Technical Documentation</li>
<li>Documentation</li>
<li>IT Documentation</li>
<li>The Knowledge Group</li>
<li>Knowledge Transfer</li>
<li>Strategic Communications &amp; Media Group</li>
<li>Customer Focused Communications</li>
<li>Global Content and Training Products</li>
<li>Customer Communications</li>
<li>User Success Group</li>
<li>Corporate Publishing</li>
<li>User Knowledge Center</li>
<li>User Assistance</li>
<li>User Help Department</li>
<li>Help Design</li>
<li>Documentation Analysis</li>
<li>Information Architect and Strategist</li>
<li>Communication Strategies</li>
<li>Customer Focused Communication Design</li>
<li>Communication Strategies and Design</li>
<li>User Assistance Strategies and Design</li>
<li>Information Strategies and Design</li>
</ul>
<p>And a few silly names:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fellowship Renowned for Excellent Documentation (FRED)</li>
<li>Masters of All Spatial Order, Chronological Hierarchies and Interesting Sorts of Trivial Stuff</li>
<li>The tellers of how stuff works and what is</li>
<li>Department of User Intelligence (DUI)</li>
</ul>
<p>None of the department names jumps out at me as "the one." In the end, I'm convinced that a slightly vague name is better than a limiting name. I'd rather be "Information Development" than "IT Documentation." In the former, you might contribute to prototype design; in the latter, you would more likely just describe the design.</p>
<p>I would rather be "Information Strategies" than "User Knowledge Center." In the former, I might make high-level analytical decisions about branding, user awareness, and task efficiency. In the latter, someone would assign me to assemble a knowledge base.</p>
<p>I would rather people said, "<em>Communication Strategies and Analysis </em>-- what the heck is that? Rather than "<em>Learning Support? </em>Oh, good, I have a group of new users that needs a Webex."</p>
<p>Have you ever had a department name that you worked against you? What department name do you prefer?</p>
