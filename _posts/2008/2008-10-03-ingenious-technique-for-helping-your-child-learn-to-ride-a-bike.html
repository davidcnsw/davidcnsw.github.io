<p>Last night my oldest daughter (who is seven years old) finally learned to ride a bike. After a few painful crashes learning the traditional way (where you just receive a push and try to go),Â <a href="http://whataboutmomblog.com/">Jane</a> read a tip on <a href="http://antiquemommy.com/2008/09/16/what-a-difference-a-day-makes/">one of her mommy blogs</a> about a new method to teach children to ride a bike:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove both pedals from the bike.</li>
<li>Lower the seat all the way.</li>
<li>Let the child scoot along with the bike using her feet for as long as she wants. This helps the child learn to balance and feel comfortable on the bike.</li>
<li>When the child asks for the pedals (my daughter asked for the pedals after two days), reattach them and raise the seat again.</li>
<li>Now give the child a little push and off she goes. </li>
</ol>
<p>I was absolutely stunned at what happened. Whereas before she'd been wobbly and would crash after about 25 feet, now she began riding like a pro. Within 5 minutes, it seemed like she'd been riding her bike for years.  For a father who felt a certain responsibility in helping his kids learn to ride a bike, watching her cruise down the street with confidence filled me with tremendous pride and gratitude.</p>
<p>My second oldest daughter is almost four. You can bet that I'm already thinking about taking the pedals off her bike.</p>
