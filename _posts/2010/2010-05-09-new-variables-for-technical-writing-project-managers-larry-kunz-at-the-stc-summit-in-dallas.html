<p>In this video, I interview <a title="Larry Kunz's blog" href="http://www.sdicorp.com/Resources/Blog.aspx">Larry Kunz</a> about new variables for technical writing project managers. Larry talks specifically about the ways agile and social media are changing the way technical writers manage projects. We recorded this video at the STC Summit in Dallas. The next day, Larry received the President's Award at the STC Summit for his work with strategic planning. (I didn't know it at the time we recorded the video, or I would have asked him about it.)</p>
