<p><a href="http://www.typographyforlawyers.com/">Typography for Lawyers</a> provides the basics of typography and general style in an easy-to-read way that would be perfectly suited not only for lawyers, but for anybody whose writing needs a little cleaning up (for example, you could send it to the project manager who keeps putting two spaces after each period). Definitely a handy resource to know about. Hat tip: <a href="http://tc.eserver.org/37117.html">tc.eserver library</a>.</p>
