<p><a href="http://www.wqusability.com">Whitney Quesenbery</a> has just published <a href="http://www.rosenfeldmedia.com/books/storytelling">Storytelling for User Experience: Crafting Stories for Better Design</a>. In this interview I ask her to elaborate on the story behind the story, how stories compare with user personas and user stories, and how to gather stories from users. We recorded this videocast at the STC Summit in Dallas.</p>
