<p>In <a href="http://kwritenow.wordpress.com/2010/01/14/screencasts-so-what/" target="_blank">Screencasts: So what?</a>, Kristi Leach tells an engaging story about a turnaround screencast. She explains how one good screencast can change users' attitudes about software. Here's an excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>I rarely watch video online. Unless it's a funny meme I have deliberately searched for, or a show that I missed, or Netflix, I won't press play. If a blog post is all video, I skip it. I rarely appreciate video instructions, eitherâ€“they take too long, because I'm pausing, following the step, playing, pausing again. I was having trouble imagining how videos were going to improve our help systems or fit into our schedules.</p></blockquote>
