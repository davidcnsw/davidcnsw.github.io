<p>On Tuesday, July 13, TechSmith is create <a href="http://visuallounge.techsmith.com/2010/07/24_screencasts_about_camtasia.html">24 Screencasts About Camtasia in 24 Hours</a>. It must be fun to do screencasts at 3 a.m. :) If you're into screencasts (and use Camtasia), these sessions should provide a lot of good information. They're streaming the screencasts <a href="http://www.livestream.com/techsmith">live here</a> and are also recording them to publish later.</p>
