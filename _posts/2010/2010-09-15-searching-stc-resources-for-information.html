<p>One of the advantages of belonging to the <a href="http://stc.org">Society for Technical Communication (STC)</a> is having access to the rich information sources on technical communication. These sources include Intercom, the Technical Communication Journal, past proceedings from conferences, the Notebook blog, and more. Unfortunately, there isn't a single search that allows you to comprehensively search all of these sources at once. I this screencast, I show you how to navigate and search the STC site to find information. </p>
