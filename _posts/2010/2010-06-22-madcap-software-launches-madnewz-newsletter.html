<p><em>The following is a sponsored message from David Ferriot of Madcap Software. </em></p>
<p>MadCap Software has launched a new  community-written newsletter, <a href="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/madnewz/june2010.aspx" target="_blank">MadNewz</a>,  aimed to give users another channel to share ideas and information with their peers. The first MadNewz post, written by Chris Sullivan, Director of Technical Communication and Social Media at AVST, covers best practices for Flare single-sourcing and includes a cost-calculator sheet available to download.</p>
<p>MadCap also plans to host a free live webinar presentation for each  article a few weeks after the article post date. Chris Sullivan's webinar will take place July 1, 2010 at 10am PST. You can sign up <a href="https://www1.gotomeeting.com/register/511929529" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>For those of you interested in submitting  article ideas, you can contact MadCap Software at <a href="mailto:madnewz@madcapsoftware.com" target="_blank">madnewz@madcapsoftware.com</a>.</p>
