<p><a href="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/products/flare?utm_source=ratherbewriting&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Flare%2BVersion%206" target="_blank">Flare 6</a> is available today from Madcap Software. This weekend I interviewed Mike Hamilton, VP of Product Management, about the new features Flare 6 contains. In this podcast, we talk about five of the new features in Flare:</p>
<ul>
<li>Batch processing GUI and macro targets</li>
<li>Topic metadata (e.g., owner, status)</li>
<li>The new link viewer</li>
<li>Mobile targets</li>
<li>Multimedia integration</li>
</ul>
<p>Mike also mentions some user interface improvements, usability refinements, and hints at upcoming integrations with SharePoint later this year or early next.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/products/flare?utm_source=ratherbewriting&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Flare%2BVersion%206">Check out Flare 6</a> on Madcap Software's site. And if you're looking for Mike Hamilton's blog, see <a href="http://madcapsoftware2.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">http://madcapsoftware2.wordpress.com</a>.  You can contact Mike by email at <a href="mailto:mhamilton@madcapsoftware.com">mhamilton@madcapsoftware.com</a>.</p>
<p>With the Flare 6 release, I'm particularly excited about the multimedia integration and link viewer. I signed up for the beta but have been so busy with an upcoming project release that I haven't had time to evaluate it. Madcap was kind enough to upgrade me to version 6 as a thank-you for the podcast, so I'll probably be posting about the multimedia integration soon (along with some screencasts using my new mic).</source></audio></p>
