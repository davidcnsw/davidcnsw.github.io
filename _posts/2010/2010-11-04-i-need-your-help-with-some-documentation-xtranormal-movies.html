<p>Last week my wife, Shannon, showed me a couple hilarious <a href="http://xtranormal.com">Xtranormal</a> videos. The first is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMvARy0lBLE&amp;amp">So, you want to be a lawyer</a>? And then, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMvARy0lBLE&amp;amp">So, you want to get a PhD in the humanities?</a></p>
<p>After watching these two, I couldn't help but think of a scenario for technical writers. The following is a conversation I'm calling, "I need your help with some documentation." The project manager represents a compilation of all the crazy things project managers have said to me over the years.</p>

<p>After I made the preceding video, I feared project managers would call me out for being unfair, so I made a second video that tries to reverse the portrayal and show technical writers in a less-than-favorable light.</p>
