<p>In this video, I talk with <a title="Whitney Quesenbery" href="http://www.wqusability.com">Whitney Quesenbery</a> and <a title="Caroline Jarrett on Forms" href="http://www.formsthatwork.com" target="_self">Caroline Jarrett</a> about the feasibility of removing links embedded directly within paragraphs -- which <a href="http://iat.ubalt.edu/summers/">Kathryn Summers</a> and <a title="Ginny Redish" href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2009/05/05/ginny-redish-letting-go-of-the-words-podcast-interview-at-stc-summit/">Ginny Redish</a> describe as "exit points" that confuse and disorient low-literacy readers.</p>
