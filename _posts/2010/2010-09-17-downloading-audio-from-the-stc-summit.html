<p>The <a href="http://www.softconference.com/stc/slist.asp?C=3145">Summit @ a Click</a> offering for <a href="http://stc.org">STC</a> Summit attendees allows you to download the audio and slide recordings of the majority of the sessions. However, most people don't know how to download just the audio. In this screencast, I show you how to download the MP3 file from each session. </p>
