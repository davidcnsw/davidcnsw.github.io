<p>Gerry McGovern explains that constantly adding tiny tasks to a home page can bury your main message. Each bit of content you add dilutes the importance of the other content.</p>
<p>I would add that the same principle applies to writing. Each word you add to a sentence removes some of the focus from the other words. Sometimes the best way to increase a sentence's emphasis is by simplifying the sentence and removing content around it.</p>
