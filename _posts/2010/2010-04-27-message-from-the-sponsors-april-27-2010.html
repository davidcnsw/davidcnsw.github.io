<h3>MadCap Software</h3>
<p>Thinking Windows, a leading provider of billing software solutions for Australian water authorities, has long embraced MadCap Flare's single-source publishing to improve efficiencies and eliminate redundancies.  But it also uses Flare for its new device-agnostic mobile output -- and recently was able to deliver online Help to GPS-enabled mobile devices around Australia in less than 30 days.</p>
<p>“We have long recognized the importance of delivering online documentation to an increasingly mobile workforce,” says Stephen Tearle, director of Thinking Windows.  “With Flare 6, for the first time there is a technical communication product on the market for device-agnostic, single-source publishing to handheld and mobile devices.  Now instead of carrying around instructional cards, the field operators have easy Web access to the information they need.”</p>

<h3>Scriptorium</h3>
<p>Sarah O'Keefe and Matt Arnold will be representing Scriptorium at the <a href="http://conference.stc.org/" target="_blank">STC Summit</a> in Dallas next week. If you're attending the conference, be sure to visit our booth to meet Sarah and Matt, pick up some chocolate, and get a free copy of our updated white paper compilation, <a href="http://www.scriptorium.com/books/the-compass" target="_blank">The Compass</a> (while supplies last).</p>
<p>If you're not attending the STC Summit, you still have a chance to pick up conference swag from us by visiting our <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/virtualbooth" target="_blank">virtual booth</a>—a short survey that asks the same questions we ask conference attendees. During the survey, you can also ask us questions about any challenges you're facing with developing and distributing technical content.</p>
<p>Complete the survey by May 5th (the day the STC Summit ends), and we'll enter you into a drawing to win one of six copies of  <em>The Compass</em>—and the winners get some chocolate, too. No Scriptorium conference booth would be complete without chocolate!</p>
