<h3>What preparation did you have for your current job?</h3>
<p>Eileen  Potter: B.A. in Advertising &amp; Public Relations, 9 years retail  operations (both field and headquarters positions; provided a great  education about business, business issues, and customer relations.)  Laid-off and re-careered into technical writing. After the layoff, 13+  years technical communications (User Assistance materials, SharePoint  Site Admin, technical white papers, sell sheets, and other marcom  materials.),</p>
<p>Richard  Rabil, Jr.: Bachelors degree in Professional Writing. During school,  did lots of journalism and freelance writing projects, plus a  professional editing internship. Also worked one year as a tech writing  intern before joining my current company full time. Currently pursuing a  masters in tech comm.</p>
<p>Susan W Gallagher: 25+ years of experience as a technical writer, technical editor, and department manager</p>
<p>Leisa Ashbaugh: 11+ years experience as tech writer (also write marketing and technical marketing web content)</p>
<p>Patty Blount: 7 years in tech comm, as a writer and a manager</p>
<p>Tom  Johnson: a bachelors degree in English and a masters in creative  writing; jobs as writer/editor, copywriter, writing teacher; a fluency  with technology</p>
<p>John  Paz: B.A. English, Tech Writing track. 4+ years as a tech writer, 2 as  a contractor, 2 in the simulation and training industry. My mother is  also an English professor (she's been prepping me since birth).</p>
<p>Anindita  Basu: 10 years as a finance executive, then a switch. Just like that.   Was always interested in writing though, and even in the non-TW avatar,  had gravitated towards writing process manuals and instructions  booklets.</p>
<p>Chris  Ninkovich: 10+ years experience writing business and marketing  communications. I graduated from the British Columbia Institute of  Technology with an Associates Certificate in Technical Writing. As a  kid, I used to LOVE reading instruction manuals for toys, games, IKEA  furniture. Maybe that helped!</p>
<p>Julio  Vazquez: 20+ years in technical communications in IBM, over 10 years  in computer operations/programming/support. AAS in Electrical  Technology, BS in Computers and Information Systems. Worked in many  aspects of information production processes.</p>
<p>Kim  Nylander: BA English, writing emphasis. Background in desktop  publishing, retail, editing, photography, and 3D imaging. Working on a  help desk. Writing professionally since high school. Hardware, tech,  gadgetry, and gaming are all hobbies.</p>
<p>Grant  Hogarth: BA English/Tech Theatre, 12y construction, 12y Theatre, MA  Rhetoric (OSU Columbus), MS Technical Communication (Rensselaer  Polytech). 18y experience as a TW.</p>
<p>Rachel  Houghton: BA English Language and Literature, minor in Professional  &amp; Technical Writing. 14 years experience as a TW.</p>
<p>Kirsty  Taylor: Working as a technical writing project manager, and before  that a technical writer with my company. Started a B INf Tech at  university, then switched after two years to a BA in Linguistics and  Business German. I mushed it all together to get into tech comm.</p>
<p>Daniel  Pintilie: BA in English and French, MS in Computational Linguistics  and 6+y experience as a TW and sometimes developer/tester.</p>
<p>Kartikeya  Dwivedi: Am a techie. Was always into Writing, and decided to make it a  full time love affair. Got a freelance Content Writing jig, took up a  Software Documentation and a Creative Writing Course, one thing led to  another, and I found my calling. It's been more learning on the job  though.</p>
<h3>What preparation do you wish you would have had?</h3>
<p>Eileen  Potter: Would have been nice to have had a basic understanding of  graphic design, typography, and how visual design elements impact  usability. Of course, now I think it would be interesting to take some  user interface/interaction design classes.</p>
<p>Richard  Rabil, Jr.: I wish I pursued visual communication much sooner and  developed multimedia skills like doing screencasts, web-based tutorials,  and voice-over narration. Also wished I had more experience with help  authoring tools and context-sensitive help.</p>
<p>Leisa  Ashbaugh: the 11 years so far serves me pretty well. When I started,  it was a dramatic career change. I did a 9 month professional  certificate program for Technical Writing &amp; Editing at the  University of Washington, and was very happy for that.</p>
<p>Patty Blount: Wish I'd finished my MS in TechComm before RPI cancelled their distance program for that degree.</p>
<p>Tom  Johnson: I wish I had pursued a masters in tech comm or digital media  rather than creative writing. Actually, it would be nice to be an  interaction designer as well, since they're held in such high regard in  our organization, and their skills (usability, user analysis) overlap  with tech comm quite a bit.</p>
<p>John  Paz: I had a lot of the writing skills I needed after my first two  years in college. I wish I minored in Tech Writing and majored in a more  technical field, some IT-related, mostly because that's what where a  lot of my interests are, and because it would have greatly increased my  earning potential.</p>
<p>Anindita Basu: I wish I knew a bit about adult learning behaviour.  That would help me create more engaging stuff.</p>
<p>Chris  Ninkovich: More knowledge about XML, DITA, single-sourcing. All that  cool and hip stuff the kids talk about in the tech writing playground.</p>
<p>Kim Nylander: A few classes in graphic design and information architecture would have been useful.</p>
<p>Grant Hogarth: Project scheduling and management, UI design theory, instructional design.</p>
<p>Rachel  Houghton: I wish I had known the “current software” at the time I  entered the field. My university only taught Desktop Publishing using  Quark Xpress, so I had to learn Framemaker on the job, using Frame for  Unix 4.0. I wish I'd had a business minor. For this job, I wish I'd had  more accounting and/or construction background.</p>
<p>Kirsty  Taylor: For my first job, more technical understanding of telephony an  IPv6, but generally, I learnt what I needed on the job. Now: knowledge  in management, leadership, internationalisation/translation, and  perhaps an MBA.</p>
<p>Daniel  Pintilie: I learned a lot by working as a TW but I wish I had more  time to study programming and IT architecture, project management and  usability design.</p>
<p>Kartikeya Dwivedi: Agree with Anindita. Human factors study would have helped. Also a course in Usability.</p>
<h3>What is your favorite task at work? Why?</h3>
<p>Eileen  Potter: I love being creative enough to solve the immediate  communication “symptom” facing someone yet analytical enough to step  back and determine a longer term solution that solves the true  communication “problem”/ business issue. For example, someone asks for a  System Limitations document but when you talk to the people who need  the info, you realize that the real solution is a searchable System  Limitations wiki that let's people understand limitations introduced by  combinations of internal and external tools/applications depending on  the version. So, in the short-term, you deliver the Sys Limits doc as  requested but you get the discussion going re: the Sys Limits Wiki (or  spark better ideas from the team.)</p>
<p>Richard  Rabil, Jr.: I love knowing a subject well enough to write about it to  others and see them “get it.” Also love teaching technology to others  using multimedia such as web-based manuals, screencasts, and help  content embedded in interfaces. It's also great fun to combine writing  with visual design and page layout -- in this way, tech writing is a  really creative, rewarding endeavor.</p>
<p>Susan W Gallagher: editing a document: I find it both relaxing and interesting work.</p>
<p>Leisa  Ashbaugh: Editing and writing. I like learning new technical info that  I would have never otherwise come in contact with. And, I like writing  succinct and complete procedure steps, and snappy marketing copy too.</p>
<p>Patty Blount: new media. Love researching new things like wikis, social networks.</p>
<p>Tom  Johnson: I like creating screencasts and interactive media content  more than anything else. People get the most excited about these kinds  of materials. There's a presumption that almost anyone can write, but  almost no one knows how to create audiovisual materials. Most users  prefer video/screencasts over written text as well.</p>
<p>John  Paz: I like to write, but the material I write about is bland. The  most joy I get is interviewing subject matter experts and discussing  what they do.</p>
<p>Anindita: Writing. Creating movies.  It's because I love to communicate and this is what lets me “talk”.</p>
<p>Chris  Ninkovich: Communicating with my team members and sharing ideas. I  love socializing with people, and tech writing allows you to do that  (believe it or not).</p>
<p>Kim  Nylander: Learning about complicated concepts and figuring out how to  explain them in plain English with illustrations (as needed).</p>
<p>Grant Hogarth: indexing, editing</p>
<p>Rachel  Houghton: my favorite part is to edit, but I also enjoy being  challenged to learn something new, or being able to occasionally do  something different. At one job, I did not just write the documentation, but  assisted in Marketing because of my Creative Suite skills.</p>
<p>Kirsty  Taylor: I like editing, but rarely have time for it. I feel so hands  off now, to when I was an individual contributor, that any time I can  get my fingers in our tools, I'm happy. :)</p>
<p>Daniel  Pintilie: I love creating task-oriented topics explaining step by step  the functionalities of a software and adding/editing the visuals.</p>
<p>Kartikeya  Dwivedi- I love the diverse writing work I get to do out here at ibruk.  One day it courseware dev, the next day it is process documentation. So  the challenge of taking up a new subject/domain, analyzing client needs  and delivering customized documentation solutions is the best part of  my job.</p>
<h3>What is your least favorite task at work? Why?</h3>
<p>Eileen  Potter: providing hours estimates, defining schedules, tracking hours,  anything repetitious: it is time that takes me away from my real job  and I know there has to be a faster way to do it.  (I understand people  are just trying to estimate/track the actual cost of developing a  product but I still don't like it.)</p>
<p>Richard  Rabil, Jr.: Being asked to “fix” poorly designed or written documents  at the last minute with little to no understanding of the audience,  technology, or context. Being asked to write a great product without  having access to the readers / end users, and extremely limited access  to the SMEs. Having to write tedious status reports and track every  single task accomplished during the day. Oftentimes, I don't do any  writing or editing on the product; it's all research, planning, or  interaction with others.</p>
<p>Susan W Gallagher: editing source code comments: working with ascii text is  tedious at best. I seem to spend more time fiddling with line length  than I do actually editing</p>
<p>Leisa Ashbaugh: tracking tasks in various bug tracking apps, and reading/editing metrics</p>
<p>Patty Blount: Making PDFs. Hate them.</p>
<p>Tom  Johnson: I hate writing documentation that users don't need. I  sometimes have to do this out of business continuity purposes -- someone  feels it's important that we have a manual about how a program works,  even though everyone who uses the program already is familiar with it.</p>
<p>John  Paz: I agree with Tom Johnson above; I cannot stand writing  documentation that's not needed. I need a job no matter what, but to  spend 40+ hours a week developing crap people don't need is  demoralizing.</p>
<p>Anindita Basu: Project Management.  I hate it (no particular reason)</p>
<p>Chris Ninkovich: I agree with Tom as well. Nothing depresses me more than writing a useless piece just to please some manager.</p>
<p>Kim  Nylander: Being asked to help write a document and being asked not to  change the writing style, layout, or online help entry style.</p>
<p>Grant  Hogarth: writing the same document over and over.  Being “edited” by  someone who has no idea what they are doing, but relies on  grammar-school prescriptions and what they may have heard from someone  in some previous office.</p>
<p>Rachel Houghton: Conditional text. Hate it.  :)</p>
<p>Kirsty  Taylor: I don't hate it, but I can find smoothing the relationships  between my team and other teams/individuals or my team's concerns over  issues emotionally draining to deal with.</p>
<p>Daniel Pintilie: I don't like to document bugs and proofread documents written by developers.</p>
<p>Kartikeya Dwivedi: Unnecessary and unproductive meetings at client sites.</p>
<h3>What skills do you consider essential to your position?</h3>
<p>Eileen  Potter: I agree with Richard below. I would also add...curiosity about  the product, curiosity about the user's business and how the product  helps them, comfortable asking questions and pursuing good  answers, not just the answer you were given. Able to distill bits of  information and understand how they come together to provide a better  picture. The ability to differentiate between developer-speak [SME  input, difficult to code, proud of their technical accomplishment] and  the impact it may or may not have on what the user actually cares about [solving business issue: User Assistance output].</p>
<p>Richard  Rabil, Jr.: Master writing and style as an art and a craft. Know how  to create usable visual materials, how to integrate audio and images  with the text, how to do information architecture, how to research the  audience, how to collect and incorporate feedback, how to negotiate with  other team members, how to learn technology or complex processes and  explain them to others, and how to plan for writing / editing challenges  that will emerge later.</p>
<p>Susan W Gallagher: language, curiosity, attention to detail, technical acumen</p>
<p>Leisa  Ashbaugh: good people skills, quick understanding of new concepts,  looking for the “missing info” and of course, good writing</p>
<p>Patty Blount: Besides good writing? The ability to understand the technology I document</p>
<p>Tom  Johnson: The ability to write, to create visual material, to learn  applications quickly, to interact with project team members, and the  ability to work extended periods of time alone.</p>
<p>John  Paz: Good writing, which can be learned/taught. But one skill I  developed that's crucial, and some people have difficultly developing,  is organization. Keeping files, documents, contacts, due dates, start  dates, and other vital information organized will make your life easier  in every way, and makes your data invaluable to other people.</p>
<p>Anindita  Basu: The ability to categorise info, the ability to prise info out of  SMEs, and the ability to translate the info to whatever I am  writing/creating.</p>
<p>Chris  Ninkovich: Communicating with others, thinking logically, being able  to learn new things quickly. Also, a love of technology is good to have,  too.</p>
<p>Kim  Nylander: Writing skill, definitely, and also a passion for what you  are writing about. Be a diplomat, evaluate all sides of a doc project,  and have a good “user hat.”</p>
<p>Grant  Hogarth: Organization, active intelligence, a high tolerance for  stupidity and corporate politics, being able to “think like the user”.</p>
<p>Rachel  Houghton: Writing skill, time management, people “management,” the  ability to see beyond just your role, and how tasks from others impact  what you do (and when you deliver). Not being afraid of technology or  using a new software tool.</p>
<p>Kirsty  Taylor: time management, interpersonal relationship skills, good  memory, decent technical understanding (I work will all development  teams in our company), managing upwards.</p>
<p>Daniel  Pintilie: Writing skills, time and project management abilities,  easiness in communicating to the SMEs, translating the technical into  plain simple language, editing images, etc.</p>
<p>Kartikeya  Dwivedi: Flair for Writing, Interpersonal skills, Communication skills,  Language skills and an ability to learn thing quickly.</p>
<h3>What skills do you think are important for every technical communicator?</h3>
<p>Eileen  Potter: In addition to the list above, realize that a “tech comm  career” is a moving target and you will always be a novice,  intermediate, expert at something in the Tech Comm continuum. As a  result, have a life-long passion to pursue the knowledge you need for a  particular moment/project in time!</p>
<p>Richard Rabil, Jr.: Same as above.</p>
<p>Susan W Gallagher: language, curiosity, attention to detail, technical acumen</p>
<p>Leisa Ashbaugh: see above answer</p>
<p>Patty  Blount: assertiveness to battle the “anyone can write” mentality,  advocating for users, a solid grasp of grammar, the ability to learn new  tools quickly, the desire to change as business needs evolve</p>
<p>Tom  Johnson: Same as above. I think it's important to position yourself in  the organization as being more than just a writer. It can be very easy  for project managers to pigeonhole you into a documentation-only kind of  role, when really you can contribute so much more, such as interface  text, workflow, video, e-learning, and more. Knowing how to lift yourself out of an organizational pigeonhole is an important skill.</p>
<p>John Paz: Attention to detail, for sure.</p>
<p>Anindita Basu: Curiosity</p>
<p>Chris  Ninkovich: If you are going to work in the software industry, know  some basic code languages. Know basic HTML. Figure out XML. Learn how to  write “topics”, not manuals. Learn about educating adults. Never stop  adding to your “skill tool-belt”. Be prepared to wear a lot of hats in  your career as a technical communicator.</p>
<p>Kim Nylander: Attention to detail. Watch current and upcoming trends for new skills to add to your skills bucket.</p>
<p>Grant  Hogarth: ability to abstract principles from concrete examples, think  about how the documents are likely to be used by the reader, solid  writing and editing skills.</p>
<p>Rachel Houghton: Same as above.</p>
<p>Kirsty  Taylor: Good communication skills, interpersonal skills, and an  inherent curiosity: we can't always rely on someone writing that design  doc or telling us what to find: we have to find it and document it.</p>
<p>Daniel  Pintilie: Transforming the complex technical world into a familiar,  clear and friendly environment for the user/reader meaning that a  technical communicator thinks first about the audience and the best way  to convey the technical information into readable and useful information  for the target audience.</p>
<p>Kartikeya Dwivedi: The aforementioned skills, attention to detail (which kinda grows on to you in this field).</p>
<h3>Do you use visuals in your work?</h3>
<p>Eileen  Potter: Yes, process flows, screenshots, PowerPoint SmartArt. One area  I'm trying to improve upon is designing true infographics where the  text, the visual, and the concept they communicate are tightly  integrated.</p>
<p>Richard  Rabil, Jr.: Frequently. I try to use screenshots, process diagrams,  icons, colors, page layout, and other such visuals as much as possible.  Effective use of white space is critical too. In my experience, people  learn and/or “get it” more quickly when pictures are involved along with  the writing--or in place of it.</p>
<p>Susan W Gallagher: sometimes</p>
<p>Leisa Ashbaugh: Not currently. But I do think they are so important. Wish I had more training/experience in that.</p>
<p>Patty  Blount: yes, definitely. People have different learning styles so I  try to address that in my work. I use Visio diagrams to explain concepts  or show system architecture, screen shots to eliminate confusion. I  recently created some YouTube videos to give users who won't “RFTFM”  another vehicle for learning product use.</p>
<p>Tom Johnson -- Yes, visuals are critical. Visual material is the most effective type of learning material, in my experience.</p>
<p>John Paz: Oh yes. And that's another favorite task of mine, learning how to use graphic tools.</p>
<p>Anindita  Basu: Not in user manuals, where I try to avoid them as far as  possible unless it's a complicated task flow or an architecture that  just cannot be explained through words.  But yes,  in movies (where I  try to avoid text as far as possible).</p>
<p>Chris Ninkovich: All the time. So learn how to use PhotoShop and Illustrator (or have a graphic artist as a friend.)</p>
<p>Kim  Nylander: Some times the most effective communication is a graphic and  not text. Any graphic that helps the reader better understand the  content is good. Gratuitous graphics are a waste of space.</p>
<p>Grant Hogarth: It depends on the document.  Some benefit greatly, while in others it's just eyecandy.</p>
<p>Rachel  Houghton: For the first time in my life, I'm not doing visuals in my  documentation. I wish I could, but the screenshots and visuals are only  used in the training department materials, and the training department  is a separate department from the information design</p>
<p>Kirsty  Taylor: We have some flow charts, but we stopped using most screen  shots a few years ago. Internationalisation and keeping on top of  thousands of screens is a big challenge.</p>
<p>Daniel Pintilie: Yes. I use visuals whenever is necessary.</p>
<p>Kartikeya Dwivedi- As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words.</p>
<h3>If so, how are these visuals generated?</h3>
<p>Eileen Potter: Visio, Full Shot, Snagit, PowerPoint, MindManager, MS Paint (I'm with you John!), MS Clip Art online.</p>
<p>Richard Rabil, Jr.: Snagit, Visio, PowerPoint, Microsoft Expression.</p>
<p>Susan W Gallagher: by me, either in Visio or Illustrator</p>
<p>Patty Blount: Visio, Photoshop, Hypersnap, Captivate</p>
<p>Tom  Johnson: Captivate, Visio, Photoshop, Snagit, Illustrator. It really  depends on what you're creating. Often you need more than just a  screenshot. You need to illustrate a concept.That's more difficult and  require some creative and technical skills.</p>
<p>John Paz: MS Paint (stop laughing, it does the job), GIMP, Photoshop (rarely, prefer GIMP), Visio, PowerPoint, and even Word.</p>
<p>Anindita  Basu: Hypersnap, Viewlet Builder for basic screenshot and for movies.   If I need a task flow, an architecture diagram, or some such picture,  we have a dedicated Graphics department to help us make cool pictures  from the back-of-napkin diagrams that I can't better.</p>
<p>Chris Ninkovich: SnagIt (for screenshots), Adobe Captivate (for training pieces), PhotoShop, Illustrator, Visio.</p>
<p>Kim Nylander: SnagIt, Pixelmator, Omni Graffle, Concept Draw</p>
<p>Grant  Hogarth: Screen captures, Photoshop, Illustrator, Balsamiq Mockups,   wireframes, and work either contracted fopr from a graphic artist or  purchased from stock.</p>
<p>Rachel Houghton: In previous jobs, I used screen captures (SnagIt), Photoshop, Illustrator, and MS Visio.</p>
<p>Kirsty Taylor: Microsoft Visio.</p>
<p>Daniel Pintilie: SnagIt, Visio, Photoshop</p>
<p>Kartikeya Dwivedi- SnagIt, Visio, Paint.</p>
<h3>About what percentage of your time on the job is spent on writing (as opposed to researching, training, etc.)?</h3>
<p>Eileen  Potter: Writing 30%, researching 15%, planning/ meetings 30%, UI  Review 15%, travel 2%, black hole of email and other time-suckers 8%</p>
<p>Richard Rabil, Jr.: Writing 25%, researching 25%, planning and editing 25%, working with others 25%</p>
<p>Susan W Gallagher: 50%</p>
<p>Leisa Ashbaugh : Editing 30%, Writing 20%</p>
<p>Patty Blount: Actual writing, 25%. The rest is research, edits, and publishing</p>
<p>Tom  Johnson: Writing, 10 percent. Research, 20 percent. Tools, 20 percent.  Meetings, 20 percent. I don't know where the remaining 30 percent goes.</p>
<p>John  Paz: First off, lol at Tom Johnson's answer. Writing: 20%, Research:  30%, Planning: 20%, Meetings: 10%, the other 20% is spent doing things  that don't matter, like filling in surveys on the job.</p>
<p>Anindita Basu: 50%</p>
<p>Chris Ninkovich: Writing: 10% Research and Planning: 60% Working with others: 20% Drinking massive amounts of coffee: 10%</p>
<p>Kim Nylander: Writing 25%; Editing 25%; Research, planning, collaborating: 50%</p>
<p>Grant Hogarth: Writing 55%, image creation/manipulation 25%, editing 10%, bug logging 10%</p>
<p>Rachel Houghton: Writing 50%; Project Management 20%; Research 20%; 10% collaboration.</p>
<p>Kirsty Taylor: 5-10%, and that's probably project plans and reports, not the real guts.</p>
<p>Daniel Pintilie: 30%. The rest is research, planning and interviewing SMEs.</p>
<p>Kartikeya Dwivedi- 40% for a solo project. Would differ on multi person projects though</p>
<h3>Approximately how much of your time is spent collaborating with others?</h3>
<p>Eileen Potter: At least 30%</p>
<p>Richard  Rabil, Jr.: About a quarter of my time. This includes working with  SMEs, managers, and if possible the end users or readers.</p>
<p>Susan W Gallagher:: 10%</p>
<p>Leisa Ashbaugh: 20%</p>
<p>Patty Blount: We are shifting to Agile; about half of my day is spent with others now.</p>
<p>Tom Johnson: Probably 20 percent. I should collaborate more than I do, not just with other project members, but with users.</p>
<p>John Paz: not nearly enough. Less than 10%, almost exclusively during meetings.</p>
<p>Anindita Basu: the remaining 50%.</p>
<p>Chris Ninkovich: 20%</p>
<p>Kim Nylander: Probably 20% collaborating (with Research and planning taking up the other 30% mentioned above)</p>
<p>Grant Hogarth: very little at my current job --- a lot at others.</p>
<p>Rachel Houghton: 10%</p>
<p>Kirsty Taylor: 75%</p>
<p>Daniel Pintilie: Depends on the project. Sometimes very much, sometimes rarely.</p>
<p>Kartikeya Dwivedi- A good 30 %</p>
<h3>In what ways do you work with others (technicians, designers, developers, editors, users, technical illustrators, etc.)?</h3>
<p>Eileen  Potter: read project wikis from developers, share docs &amp;  meeting  spaces via SharePoint, meet w/ internal SMEs (product managers, client  consultants) for creating speaking abstracts and presentation materials,  team members for editing and feedback. Marketing for more complex  graphics. Email for more detailed q's; use IM for quick bits of info;  share desktop with people in global offices.</p>
<p>Richard  Rabil, Jr.: Work with SMEs (such as developers, business analysts,  CEO, managers) to get the “big picture” business goals, to brainstorm on  how to convey a story or message, to get specifics on how a technology  or process works, and to get feedback on accuracy, etc. Work with other  writers and designers to craft the product. Work readers or end users to  understand their needs and processes, and to get their feedback on  initial drafts or prototypes.</p>
<p>Susan W Gallagher: work with developers to get information and have them  perform technical reviews on completed material; occasionally  collaborate with other writers.</p>
<p>Leisa Ashbaugh: Meetings with service management team, hallway conversations, technical reviews and questions via email</p>
<p>Patty  Blount: Developers (email) to gain product understanding, product  management for project planning information and product marketing to  reach customers. We are only now starting to use collaboration tools  like SharePoint and wikis to share information.</p>
<p>Tom  Johnson: I work with these other roles on a regular basis. Interaction  designers often need help with interface text. I often go to developers  to ask questions about functionality. Quality assurance engineers are  helpful to clarify bugs. And users are key to other kinds of  information, such as the tasks they perform, the language they use, the  kinds of help formats they need. I can outsource technical illustrations  and editing to another department, but I often don't do this because it  takes too much time.</p>
<p>John  Paz: Mostly to obtain data I can't get myself. Or to have an expert  proof something I researched. My manager has to proof my docs before  they go to the customer, and my customer can sometimes reply back with  suggested edits.</p>
<p>Anindita  Basu: With the dev team (to get the most of the info coz they're the  SMEs), with the QA team (coz they catch bugs, come up with workarounds,  and have slightly more “customer” focus than dev), with editors (for doc  structure and language), with info architects (for doc organisation, to  decide what kind of materials will be produced, to troubleshoot  production issues), with managers (because they write our appraisals :)  ), with other writers on the team (to generally toss ideas about,  gossip, and share jokes no one else gets)</p>
<p>Kim  Nylander: I work with system administrators to document the procedures  specific to supported operating systems and hardware. This material is  then organized and presented on the group's wiki. I also edit/write  documents and create illustrations for other groups as requested.</p>
<p>Grant  Hogarth: interviewing SMEs, discussing bugs with QA, and  trying to  keep Project Managers apprised of what is going on.  I'm the sole writer  here.</p>
<p>Rachel  Houghton: Attending release team meetings weekly, attending release  deliverables (working with printer/customer delivery), I'm in an Agile  environment, so my I have two team members within 10 feet (the other  half of the team is remote). I provide information to the training  department as I receive it about new features: there's often a  disconnect between engineering and training: I'm the bridge. I've been  asked to review the text for clarity in new dialog boxes, and I'm  invited to sit in on feature demos and development meetings.</p>
<p>Kirsty  Taylor: Most of my work is with others: liaising with project  managers, development managers, my team, development team members,  product management. I'm working with them to ensure their content  deliverables are being created, dates/scope is negotiated, translation  requirements.</p>
<p>Daniel  Pintilie: As a freelancer, I work mostly with SMEs and request  information about the product and I take part in some testing.</p>
<p>Kartikeya  Dwivedi- Do my own edits, illustrations and process flows. Developers  are the SMEs, and my interactions with them are to understand the  application and point out usability issues. Have been trying to get  direct end user feedback, or get in personal touch but that's a losing  battle for now. In my current process documentation jig, I am arranging  mock ups for processes and it is helping BIG time.</p>
<h3>What are your major sources of complaint and satisfaction on the job?</h3>
<p>Eileen  Potter: Sources of complaint: tech writing deadlines never slip  although the deadlines of all other depts do, thus TW is regularly  compressed. Source of satisfaction: I like helping other writers or  employees when they are struggling w/ tools or content; I'm currently  enjoying writing across all product lines in my new position.</p>
<p>Richard  Rabil, Jr.: Sources of complaint: Working over time, dealing with  last-minute stressful projects, not really knowing how effective the  final written or design product is, not being able to use the latest  technologies (I wish I could use more graphics, audio, and interactive  media), not given enough time to do quality writing and design. Sources  of satisfaction: Using the written word to make a living, working with a  great team of intelligent people, seeing when a written or designed  product gets high approval, being acknowledged as a good writer whose  opinion matters, and getting positive responses from readers.</p>
<p>Susan W Gallagher: Satisfaction is from interesting work and good people to  work with. Only complaint is that there is sometimes not enough  interaction with others on the team</p>
<p>Leisa  Ashbaugh: satisfaction for me comes when others appreciate my work. A  simple “thanks” makes my day. Complaint: crazy, broken systems for  tracking complex work items.</p>
<p>Patty  Blount: Complaint: I request reviews, get no feedback, release content  and then get a flood of complaints that the guide is wrong.  Satisfaction: When customers take the time to notify the company that  the documentation helped them.</p>
<p>Tom  Johnson: Major sources of complaint: loneliness, sedentary-ness,  feeling that no one uses the documentation, being required to create old  help formats rather than interactive media, underbudgeting from project  managers (so I don't have enough time to create good help), being  excluded from the product creation process until near release or even  post-release. Sources of satisfaction: Empowerment with tools,  exploration of new media and forms of learning, interacting with project  teams in IT environments, stable work with good pay, low-stress, freedom to innovate.</p>
<p>John  Paz: Complaint: My work doesn't matter and is excessive to  requirements, I live in constant fear I'll lose my job. Satisfaction:  technical writing is projected to have 15-30% job growth over the next  decade. Complaint: I rarely get to do any of the cool stuff I worked on  during undergrad. Satisfaction: I get to learn new things all the time, I  get to work under tight deadlines (otherwise I slack off), and I get to  write for a living (invaluable).</p>
<p>Anindita  Basu: Major source of complaint: UI changes, code changes much after  “decided” freeze dates.  Major satisfaction: Overhearing someone say,  “Heh! It's there in our docs.  Just go to this page ... and then ask me  only if you still don't understand”.</p>
<p>Kim  Nylander: Complaint: Being told, “I don't know why you bother. No one  reads the manuals any way.” Sigh. Have had that attitude amongst  coworkers at several past positions. Satisfaction: Getting an email  saying “We have documentation for that now on the wiki...” or “Did you  see this article...?” Having coworkers who come in and say “hey I had  this idea for a document...”</p>
<p>Grant  Hogarth: Satisfaction: hearing that a doc I wrote helped clinch a  sale,  knowing that I've done good work, even if others don't really  recognize it. Dissatisfaction, being treated as just an automated  typewriter, one that has no idea of what might improve the product or  process.</p>
<p>Rachel  Houghton: Complaint: hearing the old “no one reads the manuals  anyway”: when my help feedback system clearly shows that the users are  accessing software help (and which version too). Satisfaction:  currently, it's knowing that I'm providing an extra value to the team  and getting recognized for going above and beyond when necessary.</p>
<p>Kirsty  Taylor: Complaint: Working with some of the negative aspects of  significant downsizing over the past 18 months and trying to keep my  team together and focussed, regardless of what might happen around us.  And when dev managers try to tell me how to write doco/what standards to  use. Satisfaction:  I have a darn cool team who've made some great innovations in the past  year or two: things that we'd been trying to get to for years with  single sourcing. I love working with I18N and translation, it really  complements my linguistic and German experience.</p>
<p>Daniel  Pintilie: Complaint: Having to explain why I do my job and why is  important because not all the people in IT business know, requesting  feedback without answer and having no certainty that the deliverable  complied. Satisfaction: working with different people, learning new  things every day, interviewing interesting people often and sometimes a  thank you that counts a lot.</p>
<p>Kartikeya  Dwivedi- The grouse is to quantify our work and commercials, as out  work is not something completely measurable. So, it is mostly a time  taken and money asked complaint.</p>
<p>Satisfaction  comes with finishing the project, and by going that extra mile for the  client, give them more than they asked for. And yes, repeat business :)</p>
