<p>Last month I started a regular message from the sponsors post as a way to give my advertisers more visibility. Here's the second sponsor post. Lots of good information in here.</p>
<h3>Dr.Explain 4.0 Enables Rapid Creation of Software Help Systems  to Speed up Software Rollouts</h3>
<p>Indigo Byte Systems, LLC today introduces <a href="http://www.drexplain.com/" target="_blank">Dr.Explain 4.0</a>, the  most significant release of its innovative help authoring software, with  over 10 new features and enhancements, including improved interface  usability, customizable page layout, visual styles, on-demand screenshot  annotating mode, search and index functionality in HTML manuals, PDF  output and more. New Dr.Explain makes it even easier and faster to  document software, ensuring faster software rollouts. The new version is  available as a free trial from <a href="http://www.drexplain.com/" target="_blank">http://www.drexplain.com</a>.</p>
<p>Unique to Dr.Explain is its innovative approach to making help  documentation much quicker than it is with other tools. The program  parses a live application and automatically produces screenshots of its  windows along with a sequence of explanatory callouts for each control.  The process is accurate and fully automated, so the user only has to  enter a description for each callout. The project can be exported to  HTML, CHM Help, RTF or PDF format.</p>
<p>Dr.Explain 4.0 includes but is not limited to the following key new  features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improved usability: </strong>The newest version introduces a  wide work area, sleek icons and slim toolbars, contributing to increased  user satisfaction.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customizable look: </strong>In the new version, the user can  rearrange objects and change layout page content remarkably easily in  the editor.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>On-demand screenshot annotating mode: </strong>The workspace  area is grabbed only when required. The floating panels will help the  user to organize the workspace layout as needed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Search and Index in HTML manuals: </strong>This feature doesn't  require scripting capabilities on a server and may be used even on  websites with free hosting.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>PDF output: </strong>Now the user can export help documentation  to Adobe PDF with support for national characters, images, hyperlinks,  bookmarks and table of contents.</li>
</ul>
<p>A downloadable trial version is available at <a href="http://www.drexplain.com/download/" target="_blank">http://www.drexplain.com/download/</a></p>
<p>The program comes with "Compatible with Windows 7" logo.</p>
<p>More information is available at <a href="http://www.drexplain.com/" target="_blank">http://www.drexplain.com</a></p>
<p><em>P.S.:<strong> </strong>A free serial number for Dr.Explain 4.0 is provided to magazine  editors, internet columnists, bloggers and webmasters who intend to  write a review of the program on their website, blog or column.

<h3><strong>MadCap Flare the Authoring Tool of Choice for Carnegie Mellon University</strong></h3>
<p>MadCap Software was pleased to announce its latest case study highlighting how Carnegie Mellon University uses MadCap Flare to teach students documentation best practices. “In the past, students mocked up their online Help in HTML. It was extremely labor-intensive, and it didnʼt give them the practical experience of using an authoring tool,” said Tracey DePellegrin Connelly. “With Flare, the difference is night and day between what they were doing before and what they are now able to learn. Itʼs been an extremely valuable tool for giving our students real-world experience.”</p>
<p>“It can be hard to grasp the separation of content and formatting within a structured authoring environment if you are used to working with word processing and authoring packages where the formatting is applied directly to the content,” said Ms. Ciroli. “Flare did a nice job of bridging that gap. Our students liked that they didnʼt have to worry about formatting, as well as how easy it was to set up the online Help navigation using the indexing and glossary features in Flare. Whether they were technically savvy or not, all the students could get the output they needed.”</p>

<h3><strong>Flare 6 Allows Users to Work Smarter, More Efﬁciently When Reusing Content, Publishing to Multiple Outputs</strong></h3>
<p>File tagging and the WebHelp mobile output are among top of the list of favorite new features in <a href="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/products/flare/overview.aspx" target="_blank">Flare 6</a>. "Flare's new features and user interface improvements have been helping me work smarter, faster, and with better results. I'm especially pleased to see File Tags and the new WebHelp Mobile target,” says Nita Beck.</p>
<p>Flareʼs single-sourcing allows users to save time when creating the mobile output. They simply create a new output target in an existing Flare project and content can be immediately available to users on the go. Neil Perlin of Hyper/Word Services says, “This feature takes what was a separate process requiring different tools and skills and starts to make it just one more Flare output. I expect that more developers will try outputting to mobile devices now that it's easier and more convenient to do so with Flare.”</p>
