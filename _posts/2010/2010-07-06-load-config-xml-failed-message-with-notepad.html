<p><a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> is my favorite text editor, but lately it's been acting a bit berzerk. Every time I open it, NotePad++ says Load Config.xml failed, or something like that. It's been bugging me for weeks. I finally found the fix <a href="http://blog.calebzulawski.co.cc/post/530725895/notepad">here</a>. If you get a load config.xml failed message, take these general steps to fix it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to C:Program FilesNotepad++ (or wherever the program files are).</li>
<li>Copy the config. model and stylers.model files.</li>
<li>Go to C:UsersyourusernameAppDataRoamingNotepad++. (If you don't seen an AppData folder, just type the path and the files will appear.)</li>
<li>If you see an existing config.xml and stylers.xml file in this folder, delete them.</li>
<li>Paste the files you copied in step 2.</li>
<li>Rename the pasted files to config.xml and stylers.xml.</li>
</ol>
