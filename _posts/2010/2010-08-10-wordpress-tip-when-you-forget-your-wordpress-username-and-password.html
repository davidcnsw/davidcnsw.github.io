<p>In working with clients on WordPress projects, I routinely run across people who forget their WordPress username and password. Fortunately, if you still remember the FTP username and password, just upload <a href="http://yoast.com/emergency-wordpress-access/">this "emergency.php" script</a> from Yoast to your root directory, go to http://yoursite.com/emergency.php, and voila, you can change your WordPress username and password. You may need to download the wp-config.php file to grab the database password, but that's it.</p>
