<p>In an effort to give more visibility and exposure to the companies who advertise on my site, I'm providing a regular "Messages from the Sponsors" post. In this post, I asked my sponsors if they have any messages they would like me to share with my readers. Since it was the first time I asked this, not everyone was ready with content, but two of them (Scriptorium and Madcap Software) did provide messages, which I've inserted below.  </p>
