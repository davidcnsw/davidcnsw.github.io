<p>This podcast is a recording of the presentation I gave at the STC Currents conference titled "From Overlooked to Center Stage."</p>
<p>If you <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2010/04/17/from-overlooked-to-center-stage-series/">read the essay</a> and then listen to the recording, you'll notice some differences because (a) I can't remember everything I wrote in the moment that I'm presenting, and (b) oral delivery doesn't exactly work like a written delivery. Nevertheless, I tried to communicate the same story.</p>
<p><i>Note: See the <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2010/04/17/from-overlooked-to-center-stage-series/">essay that provides a narrative exposition</a> of the presentation content.</i></p>
