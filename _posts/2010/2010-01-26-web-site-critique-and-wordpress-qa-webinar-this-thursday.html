<p><a href="http://willsansbury.com" target="_blank">Will Sansbury</a> and I are giving a <a href="https://access.stc.org/imispublic/Core/Events/eventdetails.aspx?iKey=STCCE4" target="_blank">webinar on web design and WordPress</a> this Thursday as part of the STC Community Leaders series. In the webinar, we plan to look at about five chapter/SIG sites in depth, examining what they're doing well and how they could be improved. The sites will merely provide examples to spark discussion about web concepts and techniques (helping us move in a descriptive rather than prescriptive direction).</p>
<p>Here's the description of the webinar:</p>
<blockquote><p>Because most communities have far more virtual participants than physical participants, establishing a strong web presence where members can find information, interact with each other, and access resources is critical. In this community webinar, we'll review a handful of chapter or SIG sites and discuss what's working well and how they might be improved. We'll also talk about WordPress -- a popular platform many chapters are using for their websites. As a WordPress consultant, I deal with all kinds of WordPress questions, from customizing themes to implementing specific plugins, tweaking the stylesheet, inserting PHP tags, and fixing crashed sites. If you're currently managing or implementing a WordPress site, bring your questions and I'll try to answer them. I'll also go over my top 10 recommended WordPress plugins. [Note: I wrote the description before asking Will to join me in the presentation, so excuse the first person point of view.]</p></blockquote>
<p>If you're planning to attend the webinar and you want your site critiqued, let me know. Otherwise, I'm thinking of looking at these five sites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://stc-montreal.org/en/" target="_blank">STC Montreal</a></li>
<li><a href="http://stcatlanta.org/" target="_blank">STC Atlanta</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.stcsig.org/usability/index.html" target="_blank">STC Usability SIG</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.stctc.org/index.php?category=Home" target="_blank">STC Twin Cities</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www2.stctoronto.org/" target="_blank">STC Toronto</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.stc-techedit.org" target="_blank">STC Technical Editing SIG</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The webinar will have a WordPress bent to it, because it's the platform I'm most familiar with. Technical how-to is always less interesting that concepts, so I only see the discussion veering off into WordPress when we mention ways to implement concepts/techniques in a practical, easy way. I'm also familiar with Joomla and Mediawiki, so if one of those solutions makes more sense, I'll talk about them.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://access.stc.org/imispublic/Core/Events/eventdetails.aspx?iKey=STCCE4" target="_blank">sign up for the webinar here.</a></p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>In my experience with Genesys, you have to call in via phone. You can't use your computer speakers. So if you're calling internationally, you might want to use Skype.</p>
