<p>If you're looking for a solid professional development opportunity, check out the <a href="http://lavacon.org">Lavacon Conference</a> this year. Held September 29 to October 2 in San Diego, California, the conference focuses on learning how to "publish digital content that enhances the customer experience, reduces production costs and promotes your online brand."</p>
<p>If you read the <a href="http://lavacon.org/category/sessions">session descriptions</a>, it looks like an exceptional conference, especially if you have any desire to learn more about social media. Jack Molisani, the conference organizer, pulled together about 40 excellent speakers and shaped the entire conference around the theme of social media.</p>
