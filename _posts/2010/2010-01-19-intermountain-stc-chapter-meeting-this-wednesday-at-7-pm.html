<p>This Wednesday, Jan 20, there's an <a href="http://www.intermountain-stc.org/2009/12/15/january-2010-chapter-meeting/" target="_blank">Intermountain STC Chapter meeting</a> at 7 pm. in the Sandy library. Lyn Worthen will be speaking on running your own technical communications consulting business. Here's an excerpt from her description:</p>
<blockquote><p>Unlike the consistent schedule, workload, and wages of a 9-5 technical writing job, going it on your own as a consultant or contractor is a lot like riding the tide. Sometimes the tide is “in” and you have plenty of work to keep you happily tapping away on your keyboard; the projects are queuing up, the money is flowing, and all's right with the world.</p>
<p>Other times, the tide is “out” and you find yourself walking on a desolate beach, staring out at the horizon, waiting for your ship to come in — and, if you're lucky, picking up the occasional small job still lurking in a hidden tidal pool; money is scarce, and as the siren song of Corporate America tempts you back into the relative stability of captured employment, you question the wisdom of continuing to go it alone.</p>
<p>And then there are the “tsunamis,” those times when you have more work than one person should ever be expected to handle; yet in spite of the fact that you're barely keeping your head above water, you're reluctant to say “no” to any of it because you don't know how high the floodwaters will rise or how long the drought that is sure to follow will last.</p></blockquote>
<p>Everyone is invited, both STC members and non-members. Cost is free (since it's held in a public library). <a href="http://www.intermountain-stc.org/2009/12/15/january-2010-chapter-meeting/" target="_blank">Read more details here</a>.</p>
