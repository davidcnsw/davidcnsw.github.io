<p>How to break into technical writing is one of the most common questions readers ask. (If you wrote a book entirely on this subject, I'm sure you'd sell regular copies.) Recently a journalist interviewed me and others (Jack Molisani, Mike Hughes, and Andrea Ames) on this topic. He published his article, called <a href="http://career-resources.dice.com/articles/content/entry/use_your_it_experience_in">Use Your IT Experience to Move into Technical Writing</a>, in DICE.</p>
<p>I have only a small quote at the end. In one of my responses about tools, I must have mumbled Camtasia in a way that sounded like Fantasia. (But I admit the latter sounds like a more fun tool to use.)</p>
<p>The article includes excellent research and information for breaking into technical writing.  For those looking to break into technical writing, I also have an entire section on my blog dedicated to this topic. <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/for-students">Breaking into Technical Writing (as a Student or Transitioning from Another Career)</a> lists more than a dozen links with information on how to transition into technical writing. If you have more to add to my list, please send me them.</p>
<p>As a side note, the DICE writer who interviewed me is interested in moving into technical writing himself. So if you know of a company near San Jose, California looking to hire a new technical writer with excellent writing skills, let me know and I'll put you in contact with him.</p>
