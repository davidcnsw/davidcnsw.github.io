<p><em>I sent out this tip in my last WordPress newsletter. You can </em><a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/newsletter/"><em>subscribe to my WordPress newsletter here</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>I decided to start up a <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/newsletter">WordPress newsletter</a> to offer weekly tips on WordPress. I added the sign-up widget on my sidebar about a month ago. Since then, 56 people have signed up. I just sent out the first newsletter today. I'm copying the newsletter content into this post below. If this information is relevant to you, consider signing up for the newsletter. There's a sign-up form below the ads in the my sidebar. You can also <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/newsletter">sign up here</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>The Most Commonly Asked Question About WordPress I Receive</strong></h3>
<p>Let me kick off my first newsletter with an answer to the most commonly asked question I receive about WordPress:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>"Can you create a WordPress theme to match my original HTML site?"</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Most people don't realize that WordPress can act as a lite content management system, allowing you to manage all of your website content in WordPress. The home page of your site doesn't need to be a list of your latest posts. Your home page can be a static page that describes your company or services. You can then make your WordPress posts appear on another page.</p>
<p>You can configure all of this under Settings &gt; Reading. So when people ask if I can create a theme to match their original site, I usually tell them they can migrate their entire content to WordPress and manage it more conveniently there. It's a much better strategy than managing two sites separately.</p>
<p>I want to provide one more tip. If you need an attractive WordPress theme, take a look at the themes at <a href="http://woothemes.com/" target="_blank">http://woothemes.com</a>. Woothemes is one of the best theme development sites for WordPress. I have a developer account with woothemes that allows me to use their themes on as many client sites as I want. So if you see a theme you want, just ask me for it and I'll send it to you for free. I think the <a href="http://www.woothemes.com/demo/?name=exposure" target="_blank">Canvas theme</a> (a minimalist theme) is particularly well-built. (Of course if you want me to implement and customize it for you, I would charge for that.)</p>
<p>I hope to provide more regular tips on WordPress. In a couple of weeks, WordPress 3.0 will be released. WordPress 3.0 will contain a new default theme, among other new features. If you want to check out the new default theme in WordPress, <a href="http://2010dev.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">explore it here</a>. I like this theme so much I almost implemented on my own site. I'll provide more details in the coming newsletters about the features 3.0 has.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, feel free to <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/contact">send them to me</a>.</p>
