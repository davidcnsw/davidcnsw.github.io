<p>In this videocast, I talk with Neil Perlin at <a href="http://hyperword.com">hyperword.com</a> about the trend toward mobile outputs for help and other information deliverables. Neil had just given a demonstration of a mobile output from Flare, and he mentioned to me that mobile was a direction he wants to specialize in. We recorded this video in the Expo hall at the STC Summit in Dallas.</p>
