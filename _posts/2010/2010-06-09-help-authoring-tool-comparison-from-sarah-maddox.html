<p>Even though I dismissed the relevance of help authoring tools <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2010/06/03/from-help-authoring-tools-to-web-tools-especially-wikis-organizing-content-12/">in my last post</a>, I thought this <a href="http://ffeathers.wordpress.com/2010/05/30/aodc-day-3-help-authoring-tool-comparison/">writeup by Sarah Maddox on help authoring tools</a> from a presentation by Matthew Ellison at a tech comm conference in Australia was worthwhile and helpful. Sarah paraphrases Matthew:</p>
<blockquote><p>HATs hide the complexity and allow you to concentrate on the content.  You don't need to worry about coding and scripting, conditional tags  and other mechanics under the hood.</p>
<p>HATs produce some very nice output, such as browser-based help  (WebHelp), PDF and many other types. On the whole, HATs produce the  tri-pane output format of online help. If that's what you need, they  make it very easy to do.</p>
<p>They provide help-specific features such as context sensitivity,  indexing, dropdowns and related topics.</p>
<p>You can also use HATs for single sourcing.</p>
<p>In summary, HATs cater to our specific needs as technical writers.</p></blockquote>
