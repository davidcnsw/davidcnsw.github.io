<p>If you're in Utah and interested in e-learning, come to the <a href="http://www.intermountain-stc.org/2010/06/01/june-e-learning-event/">June e-Learning event held by the Intermountain-stc chapter</a>. I'll be giving a presentation on developing a personal voice in audio. It's the same presentation I gave at the Summit in Dallas:</p>
<blockquote><p>Chapter member Tom Johnson will present on how to develop a personal  voice in audio. You'll learn how to create video tutorials with a  friendly, personable voice by implementing several audio techniques  common to professional voice talents and sound engineers. In this  session, Tom will cover the following audio strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finding an acoustic environment</li>
<li>Sounding natural</li>
<li>Setting up your microphone</li>
<li>Controlling your breathing</li>
<li>Avoiding rambling</li>
<li>Rehearsing the script</li>
<li>Imagining a scenario</li>
<li>Dealing with mistakes</li>
<li>Post-processing the audio</li>
<li>Improving your voice</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
