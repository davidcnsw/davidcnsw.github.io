<p>I've come across a couple of free tools that may prove useful for surveys and webinars.</p>
<p>Surveys: <a href="http://surveygizmo.com">www.Surveygizmo.com</a><br />
Allows you to create surveys with up to 250 responses for free</p>
<p>Webinars: <a href="http://vyew.com">www.vyew.com </a><br />
Free webinar tool (but I need to explore it more)</p>
<p>Has anyone had any experience with these two tools?</p>
