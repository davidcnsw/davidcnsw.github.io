<p>The new podcasting site is finished. Check it out at ----------------. We have a couple of new interviews up there, including Mike Hamilton and Scott Abel. You can subscribe either via RSS or e-mail, thanks for Feedburner. Let me know what you think. More importantly, if you want to contribute audio content to the site, or just have suggestions for topics, let me know.</p>
<p>12/23/2007 Update: The podcasting site has been merged into this site.</p>
