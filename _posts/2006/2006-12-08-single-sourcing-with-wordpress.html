<p>Word 2007 is available. It looks quite interesting -- definitely different. Here's <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/microsoft_office_word/archive/2006/09/18/761200.aspx">a post from the Microsoft Team blog</a> about it, with a demo video. Be sure to watch the video. I haven't experimented with it yet, but hope to soon.</p>
