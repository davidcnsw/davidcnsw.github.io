<p>Just saw this in a survey someone conducted: <a href="http://websort.net/">http://websort.net/</a><strong> </strong></p>
<p>You have a large list of items and then must drag them into what you believe to be the appropriate categories. In this way, it helps you determine the most logical place to put your information -- based on user perspective, rather than your own.</p>
