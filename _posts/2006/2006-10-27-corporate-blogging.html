<p>I'm happy to say that we've been blogging at my work for the last 3-4 months and it has been well-received. We're using SharePoint as a blogging tool -- not really the normal tool for blogging, but it actually works pretty well. People can subscribe to alerts to a discussion, and you can also sort your discussion by specific categories.</p>
<p>I find that if it makes a nice substitute for email. When you have something to share, but don't want to send an e-mail blast, the blog is perfect. It doesn't clog inboxes, and people can respond at their leisure.</p>
<p>By the way, you should check out the September Intercom article on corporate blogging -- it's a good read.</p>
