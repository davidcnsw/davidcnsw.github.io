<p>If you ever need to find out exactly where an IP address is located geographically, this is an amazing tool: <a href="http://www.ip-adress.com/">http://www.ip-adress.com/</a>. I think it's a mashup of Google maps and some kind of IP address database.</p>
<p>This removes some anonymity from the web, but is convenient in tracking things.</p>
