<p>If you need a free tool to open zipped files, tar files, or other types of compressed folders, and to likewise zip folders yourself, check out 7 Zip. I've been using it for a month now (after my Power Archiver trial ended), and I've found 7 zip does everything I ever need it to -- and it's free. </p>
