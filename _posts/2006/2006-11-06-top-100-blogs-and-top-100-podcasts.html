<p><a href="http://share.opml.org">http://share.opml.org</a>&nbsp; is a site that shows you the top 100 blogs and top 100 podcasts based on OPML files that users submit. (OPML files are lists of all the feeds you're subscribed to with your news aggregator.) I wish I could create something like this for technical writers.</p>
