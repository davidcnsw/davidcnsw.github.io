<p>The Photoshop TV podcast receives about 2 million downloads a month. If you create a podcast with a how-to focus, your popularity will explode. People search for information, research, knowledge. They want to learn how to do things. <a href="http://www.printondemand.com/MT/archives/008610.html">http://www.printondemand.com/MT/archives/008610.html</a></p>
