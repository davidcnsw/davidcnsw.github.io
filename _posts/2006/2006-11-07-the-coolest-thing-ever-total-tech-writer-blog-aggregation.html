<p>For some time now, I've maintained a list of technical writing blogs on stc-suncoast.org. And I've had them all aggregated in my own Feeddemon newsreader. By aggregate I mean my newsreader pulls together all the content into one long flow of information, arranged chronologically. Now you can get the same effect without a newsreader -- I've aggregated them with Blogdigger. </p>
<p>Here is the link of aggregated technical writing blogs: <a href="http://groups.blogdigger.com/groups.jsp?id=3412">http://groups.blogdigger.com/groups.jsp?id=3412 </a></p>
