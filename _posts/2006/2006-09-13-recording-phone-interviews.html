<p>I think I'm finally getting ready to start recording some phone interviews. This article from hotair.com gives specific instructions for recording phone interviews and turning them into podcasts: <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2006/04/24/how-to-podcast-record-phone-interviews-and-have-your-own-talk-radio-show-for-less-than-fifty-bucks/">http://hotair.com/archives/2006/04/24/how-to-podcast-record-phone-interviews-and-have-your-own-talk-radio-show-for-less-than-fifty-bucks/</a></p>
<p>Here is roughly how to do it:</p>
<p>1. Get a headphone/mic set from Radio Shack or wherever ($20).</p>
<p>2. Download and setup Skype (free, but to call regular phone numbers, $10).</p>
<p>3. Download Hot Recorder (hotrecorder.com). Pay for the premium version ($15). After setting it up, right-click the icon in your system tray and select Register so you can enter your serial number. (The free edition only records 2 minute conversations.)</p>
<p>4. In Hot Recorder, under Options, select Mono. Otherwise you'll end up with two tracks.</p>
<p>5. Call the person you're interviewing and click the Record button to start recording the phone conversation.</p>
<p>6. After you're finished and click Stop, open up the Audio Converter tool (Start > Programs > Hot Recorder (note: Don't look in the subfolders beyond the Hot Recorder folder).</p>
<p>7. Use Audio Converter to convert the ELP file to a WAV or MP3 file format.</p>
<p>8. Download and set up Audacity (free).</p>
<p>9. In Audacity, go to Edit > Preferences > Quality and in the Default Sample Rate drop-down box, select Other, then type 12000. This makes it so the recording rate in Audacity matches the recording rate that Hot Recorder uses.</p>
<p>10. Add introductory commentary and other podcast talk using Audacity, and then mix the tracks into one.</p>
<p>11. Export the file as MP3, being careful to set the Project Rate (lower-left corner) at 44100. Otherwise the voices will sound like chipmunks in Podpress.</p>
<p>12. Set up a Wordpress site hosted on your Wordpress blog.</p>
<p>13. Install the Podpress plugin.</p>
<p>14. Burn the feed with the Feedburner plugin so you can track stats.</p>
<p>15. Publish the podcast.</p>
<p>Those are the general steps. I have left out many of the details, but I think I hit all the bases. I am planning to try out this method this Saturday with a couple of podcasts, and then I'll come back to this and add more details. In fact, I may just create it in Word because Wordpress isn't so great for elaborate instructions.</p>
