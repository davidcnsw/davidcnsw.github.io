<p>If you've been thinking about getting into podcasting, consider joining the <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com">Tech Writer Voices</a> podcasting team. We only have several members right now, and we're just getting started, but we eventually want to grow into a dozen members, who are all creating interesting podcasts and publishing them on Tech Writer Voices. </p>
<p>You'd be amazed at how much fun it can be to interview someone. Editing and post-production time are minimal. It's actually easier and better to do phone interviews than record your chapter presenters. And you have a greater control over the topics. If you're interested in learning more, let me know by sending an email to tomjoht@gmail.com. Equipment will cost you $50, but no more (headset = $30 and recording software (Pamela) = $20). Ask your chapter to subsidize it.</p>
