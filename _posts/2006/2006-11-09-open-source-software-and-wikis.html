<p>Intel is coming out with a total web 2.0 package -- a suite that includes tools for blogging, wikis, feeds, and other collaboration tools built in. The suite combines Newsgator, Simplefeed, Socialtext, and Movable Type. <a href="http://www.cmswire.com/cms/industry-news/intels-enters-web-20-fray-with-suitetwo--000875.php" target="_blank">Here's the article.</a><a href="http://www.cmswire.com/cms/industry-news/intels-enters-web-20-fray-with-suitetwo--000875.php%20"> </a></p>
<p>More on Socialtext -- A new product called SocialPoint from SocialText apparently can sit on top of SharePoint. SocialText offers some powerful wiki tools. I am still discovering the power of wikis, but services like Google Docs (docs.google.com) certainly look interesting. Google Docs allows you to essentially use tools comparable to Word and Excel over the web, and have others collaborate on the same projects.</p>
<p>Here's a link to a lot of cool open source software: <a href="http://www.opensourcewindows.org/">http://www.opensourcewindows.org/</a></p>
<p>And here is a list of unusual deaths as compiled by wikipedia: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unusual_deaths">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unusual_deaths</a></p>
<p>Certainly this list is something that no one person could generate alone. I will have to look into ways to harness wikis.</p>
<p>The last two links I found using the Stumble Upon extension for Firefox. It's part of the social software phenomenon -- people vote on cool sites, and the top ranked sites are more likely to be stumbled upon.</p>
