<p>Check this out: <a href="http://api.maps.yahoo.com/Maps/V1/annotatedMaps?appid=asdfjkl1&xmlsrc=https://idratherbewriting.com/map.xml">http://api.maps.yahoo.com/Maps/V1/annotatedMaps?appid=asdfjkl1&xmlsrc=https://idratherbewriting.com/map.xml</a>. Four addresses of my friends appear there. I can include up to 100 or more, I believe.</p>
<p>The address points are stored on an XML file stored on my server. Using a few quick instructions from Yahoo's API kit, I can have those points displayed on the Yahoo Maps. This is what's known as the Yahoo Maps API kit.</p>
<p>Instructions for using the Yahoo Maps API are here: <a href="http://tolstoy.com/blog/2005/07/how-to-use-the-yahoo-maps-api-000011.html">http://tolstoy.com/blog/2005/07/how-to-use-the-yahoo-maps-api-000011.html</a>Â </p>
<p>Wouldn't it be cool if you could see an entire membership directory where all the members live? Maybe people might object to this -- I'm not sure. But it might increase collaboration and interactivity among members.</p>
