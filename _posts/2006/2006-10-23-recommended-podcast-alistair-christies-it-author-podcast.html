<p>If you like the Tech Writer Voices podcast, then you'll probably also like Alistair Christie's podcast, which is called IT Author Podcast and can be found here: <a href="http://www.itauthor.com/wordpress/category/podcasts/" target="_blank">http://www.itauthor.com/wordpress/category/podcasts</a>. Alistair is a technical writer from the UK, and has a pleasing conversational style to his podcasts. He also has an incredible depth of information about technical writing. I was honored to be a guest on his recent show.</source></audio></p>
