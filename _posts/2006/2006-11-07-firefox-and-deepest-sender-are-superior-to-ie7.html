<p>I've been somewhat of a latecomer to Firefox. Earlier versions of the browser seemed to load content more slowly than IE. But Firefox 2.0, esp. with the Fasterfox extension, loads content much faster than IE7. Plus, one of the best benefits of the Firefox browser is the Deepest Sender extension. This extension makes posting to your blog much, much easier. All you do is click a button on your browser, and a dialog box pops up that interfaces remotely with your blog. There are many more extensions too -- I just really like Firefox now. </p>
<p>If you haven't used Firefox, you're missing out. See <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/</a> to download it.</p>
