<p>Scott Abel with the Content Wrangler has been the one of the advocates behind the mergence of DITA and Structured Blogging, and he promises that it wouldn't be too long before DITA is offered as one of the microformats. This would enable lay people to publish DITA structured posts by merely filling in fields in a blog post.</p>
<p>The emergence of DITA as the next-generation help format for technical writers is growing in popularity, but the perfect tool for the task has so far been elusive. This is of course part of the point of DITA -- it isn't married to a specific tool. It can survive long after the tool dies. </p>
