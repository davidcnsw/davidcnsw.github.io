<p>This is my first post from Word 2007. In creating a new document, you have the option of writing a blog post. I think that is about the coolest thing in the world.</p>
<p>I was actually seeing testing out Word tonight to see if the numbering structure fixed the numbering problem when generating a print output from RoboHelp. Nope, but I'm pretty sure the problem is with RoboHelp rather than Word.</p>
<p><strong>Here's</strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt">a</span><br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">little</span><br />
<span style="color: red">formatting</span>.</p>
<p>Wow, Word 2007 is amazing. It is about 100 times better than Word 2003, mainly because you can find things -- quickly. It's usable. I love the tabs, and the style sets. I'm already a convert.</p>
