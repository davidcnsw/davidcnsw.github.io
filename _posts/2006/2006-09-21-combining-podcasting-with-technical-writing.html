<p>Check out this audiovisual tutorial on using podpress, a plugin that allows you to podcast from your wordpress blog. <a href="http://www.mightyseek.com/podpress/podpress-tutorial/">http://www.mightyseek.com/podpress/podpress-tutorial/</a></p>
<p>The tutorial uses Camtasia Studio to deliver a video tutorial with audio content. Unlike more elaborate tutorials using tools like Captivate, the Camtasia Studio allows you to put more focus on your voice. There's something that's really nice about hearing someone speak in a personal tone, who is not reading from a script. The combination of podcasting with technical instructions has amazing potential. I think I may try to create a tutorial like this for wordpress.</p>
