<p>My hard drive finally crashed. I never thought it would really happen, and I didn't have my files backed up. Oh well. I think I'll take it to a data recovery service. It crashed so bad that it clicks now when you try to boot up. The computer is a Gateway -- I don't recommend them. Only 1.5 years old.</p>
