<p>For the next 12 days, I'm coordinating with various companies to give away a product a day, as part of a <em>12 Days of Christmas in June</em> theme. This is an opportunity to try out new software that may be new to you, for companies to receive a bit of promotion, and to kick off the blog fun that will last all summer long.</p>
<p>Here's how the contest works: Each morning at 6 a.m. MST I'll post a new cartoon, hand-drawn by my colleague Ben Minson of <a href="http://gryphonmountain.net" target="_blank">Gryphon Mountain</a>, who is also a cartoonist. The cartoon will need a caption. To win the contest, you must supply the best caption in the comments below the post. The caption winner receives the product for that day.</p>
<p>Here are the products available and their corresponding dates:</p>
<ul>
<li> Day 1 -- Thursday, June 4: <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/screen-capture.asp" target="_blank">Snagit </a></li>

<li>Day 12 -- Tuesday, June 16: <a href="http://www.author-it.com/" target="_blank">Author-it</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The best caption will be a completely subjective decision chosen by either me or someone I designate. This is not a random selection drawing. Winners will be announced each morning at 6 a.m. EST, right before the next cartoon appears.</p>
<p>Note that you can submit as many captions as you want on any given day. If you win one day, you can also win the next as well, so don't save all your best captions for one day. Also, when you submit your caption, you give us rights to use the caption in future material as we see fit (though nothing is planned). Winners will receive a serial number and download link to the product.</p>
