<p>This is part II of the Blogging, Podcasting, and Screencasting presentation that I gave to the <a href="http://www.stc-transalpine.org/conferences/vienna-2009/" target="_blank">TransAlpine conference in Vienna</a> in June 2009. For more details about the podcast, see <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2009/06/14/blogging-podcasting-and-screencasting-eight-characteristics-to-find-devoted-followers-part-i/">the first write-up</a>. If you haven't listened to <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2009/06/14/blogging-podcasting-and-screencasting-eight-characteristics-to-find-devoted-followers-part-i/">Part 1</a> yet, listen to that first (unless you prefer to arrive <em>en media res</em>).</p>
<p>Here's the accompanying <a href="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/podcasts/blogging_podcasting_screencasting.ppsx">PowerPoint.</a></p>
<p>If you're wondering why I didn't just combine the two audio files in the same post, iTunes doesn't read the second audio file that way. Also, most people's attention spans tend to time out after an hour.</p>
<p>As always, I love to hear feedback, so if you enjoyed listening to the presentation, drop me a line or leave a comment. Thanks.</source></audio></p>
