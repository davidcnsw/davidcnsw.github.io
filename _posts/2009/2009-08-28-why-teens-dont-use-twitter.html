<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/26/technology/internet/26twitter.html?th&amp;emc=th">Fascinating NYTimes.com article</a> about why teenagers don't use Twitter (linked by <a href="http://www.publish2.com/journalists/eddie-vanarsdall">Eddie VanArsdall</a>). A few reasons teens avoid Twitter: it makes it difficult to hide what they're doing, parents don't want teens interacting with strangers, the communication is less friend driven and more professional oriented, the tweets are better for marketing or asking questions or broadcasting ideas. Although I tweet, I certainly wouldn't want my kids on Twitter. A kid may have a website, sure, but to actually know that people online are "following" my children would creep me out. On the other hand, the rampant texting (teens' favorite means of communication) blows my mind. 500 in a day? Are you kidding?</p>
