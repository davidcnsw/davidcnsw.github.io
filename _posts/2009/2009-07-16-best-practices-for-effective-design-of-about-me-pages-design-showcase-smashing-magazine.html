<p><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/07/01/best-practices-for-effective-design-of-about-us-pages/">Best Practices For Effective Design Of "About me"-Pages | Design Showcase | Smashing Magazine</a>. Smashing Magazine routinely comes out with posts that have 50+ examples of something. Usually I gloss over these posts, but the About Me page is critical for a blog, so I read it more carefully. Readers want to know a little about the author they're reading. My About Me page isn't that exciting -- certainly not creative or artsy enough to make Smashing Magazine's list. I work on my About Me every now and then, trying to figure out what to say because I know it's one of the most read pages on a blog. I just updated my <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/about">About page</a> page again tonight, adding a little more detail. I'm never quite sure if it's interesting or if answers questions people have.</p>
