<p>InÂ <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2008/12/03/when-is-the-best-time-and-day-to-publish-a-blog-post/">When is the Best Time and Day to Publish a Blog Post</a>, Lorelle Van Fossen explores a question that has become increasingly more relevant to me: when to publish your posts. I definitely get more responses to posts that I publish Sunday evening through Thursday, similar to Lorelle's experiences.</p>
<p>Also, most of the traffic seems to come during work hours. This tells me that my audience considers my blog somehow related to their work (that, or a welcome distraction from work). One insight Lorelle says is that you should publish <em>before </em>the moments of highest traffic on your site, similar to preparing a dinner table with food ready to eat before the guests arrive. Nice analogy.</p>
<p>I also find that I'm more comfortable publishing during off-work hours, because I don't want people to think I'm blogging at work, even if I've already told my manager that I schedule posts to publish at specific timestamps.
