<p><a href="http://www.itauthor.com/2009/06/20/inkscape-the-free-alternative-to-adobe-illustrator/">Inkscape: the free alternative to Adobe Illustrator</a>. Alistair Christie references two open source alternatives to Illustrator: Inkscape and Raven. Students are always asking me how they can master power tools without having a budget to buy them. If you use these open source apps to create engaging diagrams and illustrations, employers probably won't care what tool you used. You demonstrate your skills using any tool to get the job done.</p>
