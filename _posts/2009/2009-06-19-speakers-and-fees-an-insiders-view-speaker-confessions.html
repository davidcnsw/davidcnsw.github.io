<p><a href="http://www.speakerconfessions.com/2009/06/speakers-and-fees-an-insiders-view/">Speakers and fees: an insiders view | Speaker Confessions</a>. In a world of online video and online interaction (whether from videocasts, podcasts, or webinars), why do people still go to conferences to watch speakers in person? This writer says there's more energy in the room, which you can't duplicate through virtual mediums.Â  I'm not sure the energy in the room is a sufficient benefit, though. Conferences are often social events more than learning events.</p>
