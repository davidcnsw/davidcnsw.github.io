<p><a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/contenttiousstrategy">A List Apart: Articles: Content-tious Strategy</a>. This looks to me like a seminal post in the content strategy movement. Jeff Macintrye is both witty and articulate. Content strategy is a good way of thinking about our profession. It's a lot sexier term than "technical communication" and encompasses more. Content strategy feels more like the direction people who shout "I'm more than just a writer" have been trying to head for years. Thanks to Geoff Sauer at <a href="http://tc.eserver.org/" target="_blank">tc.eserver.org</a> for the tip.</p>
