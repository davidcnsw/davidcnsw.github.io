<p>I wrote a <a href="http://www.dmncommunications.com/weblog/?p=1240" target="_blank">guest post on Unstoppability</a> for my friends Scott Nesbitt and Aaron Davis at <a href="http://dmncommunications.com" target="_blank">DMN Communications</a>. Scott and Aaron are two technical communicators based in Toronto who have an <a href="http://www.dmncommunications.com/weblog/" target="_blank">engaging blog</a> I regularly follow.</p>
<p>By the way, I rarely write guest posts. In my 3+ years of blogging, this is only the second guest post I have ever written. I hope you enjoy it.</p>
