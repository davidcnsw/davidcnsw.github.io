<p>Eddie VanArsdall reviews three books on DITA in his post, <a href="http://www.contentinsomnia.net/slouching-towards-ditaville/">Slouching Toward Ditaville</a>. If you're interested in adopting DITA, or even if you just want to borrow some of its best practices, check out one of these books -- by Rockley, Vazquez, and Comtech.</p>
