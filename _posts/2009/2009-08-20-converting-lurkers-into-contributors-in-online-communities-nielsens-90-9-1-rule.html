<p><a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/participation_inequality.html">Jakob Nielsen explains that with web 2.0 communities</a>, 90% are lurkers who never contribute, 9% contribute a little, and 1% actively contribute. I wish I knew the secret formula for reversing those statistics. Nielsen mentions a few strategies for improving those stats at the end. One strategy is to take advantage of"read wear," which refers to the natural marks of reading. Online, I believe it means to give more weight or to make more visible content that has more hits.
