<p><a href="http://www.theblockheadblog.co.uk/2009/06/does-stc-deserve-to-survive.html">The Blockhead Blog: Does the STC deserve to survive?</a>. David Farbey has written an engaging article on the STC question. He asks a poignant question, "<span style="line-height: 20px; color: #333333;">Do Board members not realise that the financial crisis is just an acute symptom of an underlying chronic condition, which is the decline of the Society?" The posts I've seen and the subsequent responses seem to call for a radical overhaul of the Society, but few believe it will happen.</span></p>
