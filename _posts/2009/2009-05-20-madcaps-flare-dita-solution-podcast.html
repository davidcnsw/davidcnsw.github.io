<p>In this podcast, <a href="http://madcapsoftware2.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Mike Hamilton</a> of <a href="http://madcapsoftware.com/" target="_blank">Madcap Software</a> talks about their phased approach to handling <a href="http://madcapsoftware.com/solutions/dita/">DITA with Flare</a>. In Phase I, you'll have the ability to import DITA topics and export to webhelp and other targets. In this sense, Flare functions as a transform engine. In Phase 2, you can use Flare for native DITA authoring. Phase 1 is on the cusp of release, but Phase II won't be available until quarter one of next year.</source></audio></p>
