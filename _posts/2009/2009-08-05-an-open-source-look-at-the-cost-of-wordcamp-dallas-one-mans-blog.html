<p>I had no idea it <a href="http://onemansblog.com/2009/07/13/an-open-source-look-at-the-cost-of-wordcamp-dallas/">cost so much to run a Wordcamp conference</a>. Apparently Wordcamp Dallas cost about $20k. Wow, I thought it would have been a tenth of that. As much as I enjoy them, I don't think I'll ever get involved in planning and running a conference.</p>
