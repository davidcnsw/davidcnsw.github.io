<p>I recorded a carcast on the way home this evening. In the carcast, I explain how I've changed <a href="http://writerriver.com" target="_blank">Writer River</a> to incorporate <a href="http://publish2.com" target="_blank">Publish2.com</a>'s link sharing technology. Using Publish2, you add links to your blog, twitter account, and a technical communication newsgroup at the same time. Publish2 provides a robust platform for managing and publishing your links. I also talk about why I'm interested in Writer River and the purpose behind link blogging.</source></audio></p>
