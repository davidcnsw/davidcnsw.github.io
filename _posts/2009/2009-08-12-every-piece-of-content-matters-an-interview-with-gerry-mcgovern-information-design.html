<p><a href="http://www.infodesign.com.au/uxpod/gerrymcgovern">Listened to this podcast</a> last night and this morning. Gerry McGovern talks about the importance of "care words" on a website. These words are the content people are looking for but aren't using in the search engines. He says finding the right words to match what the customer is looking for can make a huge impact on how the customer interprets the relevance of the site. For those non-podcast listeners, Gaffney transcribes the podcast too.</p>
