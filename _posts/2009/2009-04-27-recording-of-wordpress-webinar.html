<p>Last week I <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2009/03/18/introduction-to-wordpress-webinar-april-14/" target="_self">gave a webinar</a> on <a href="http://wordpress.org" target="_blank">WordPress</a> to the <a href="http://stc-suncoast.org" target="_blank">STC-Suncoast chapter</a>. I recorded the webinar using <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.asp" target="_blank">Camtasia Studio</a>. If you have some time on your hands (for example, if you're going on a plane ride to Atlanta and you have a few layovers), you can watch the webinar on your computer.</p>
<p>A few notes about the webinar. First, your computer's resolution needs to be at least 1280px wide, because this is how I recorded it. Also, to watch it online, you need to have high bandwidth. I also made a version you can download for this very reason. Third, ideally I would break this presentation into smaller sections, tagging each section with labels in a table of contents. But that would require my whole evening, so I decided to pass on doing that.</p>
<p>The file is about 275 MB, which is quite large. If your bandwidth is restrictive, try downloading the zip version. After downloading and extracting the zip file, click the .html file in the folder.</p>
