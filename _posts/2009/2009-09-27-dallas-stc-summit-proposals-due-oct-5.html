<p>If you're thinking about submitting a proposal to present at the next STC Summit in Dallas, Texas, the deadline is October 5. See the <a href="http://www.softconference.com/subs/stc/2010/">proposal site for details</a>. Presenting is a good idea for a number of reasons. Presenting either gives you a discount or free registration to the conference. It gives you something to focus on during the long winter months. And if you're passionate about your topic, you raise the quality of the STC Summit.</p>
<p>It's also fun to be among so many professionals in the field, to see them all gathered together in one bustling, energetic conference center. If you do submit a proposal, my advice is to submit just one presentation, because having to present at multiple sessions <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2009/05/08/stc-summit-atlanta-adventures-the-agony-and-ecstasy-of-presenting/" target="_self">can be stressful.</a> This past week I've been listening to the archive of recorded podcasts and am amazed at all the informative, helpful sessions I missed.</p>
