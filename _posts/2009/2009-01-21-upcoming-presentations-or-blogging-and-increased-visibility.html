<p>When you blog, you increase your visibility tenfold. And with increased visibility, you're more frequently invited to speak at events. This year I have a handful of presentations I'm giving at various chapters and events. I decided to add an <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/upcomingpresentations">Upcoming Presentations</a> button on my navigation bar to list them. If you'd like me to speak at your chapter, conference, or other event, let me know.</p>
<p>Here's my 2009 schedule so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>February 19. Blogging. <a href="http://www.stcrmc.org/">Rocky Mountain STC chapter</a>, Colorado. (webinar)</li>
<li>February 26.  Quick Reference Guides. <a href="http://intermountain-stc.org">Intermountain-STC chapter</a>, Utah. (co-presenting)</li>
<li>March 26. Podcasting. <a href="http://podcamputah.com">Podcamp Utah</a>.</li>
<li>May 3-6. Blogging (pre-conference workshop). <a href="http://conference.stc.org/">STC Summit</a>, Atlanta.</li>
<li>May 3-6. Blogging (regular presentation). <a href="http://conference.stc.org/">STC Summit</a>, Atlanta.</li>
<li>May 3-6. Quick Reference Guides. <a href="http://conference.stc.org/">STC Summit</a>, Atlanta (co-presenting)</li>
<li>April 7. WordPress.  <a href="http://stc-suncoast.org">STC Suncoast chapter in Florida</a>. (webinar)</li>
<li>November 5. WordPress/Blogging. <a href="http://stc-suncoast.org">STC Suncoast chapter</a>, Florida.</li>
</ul>
<p>Honestly, I've never spoken at so many events in one year. Last year I presented at the STC Summit on podcasting and participated on a panel about marketing yourself in a web 2.0 environment. I also presented on WordPress at <a href="http://doctrain.com/west">Doc Train West</a> and gave a webinar to <a href="http://www.stc-phoenix.com/">STC Phoenix</a> about help and web 2.0. The year before that, I only presented on blogging usability at Doc Train West.</p>
<p>So essentially, the number of events I've been invited to speak at have at least doubled every year since I've been blogging. This points to an interesting phenomenon. Blogging = Visibility.</p>
<p>Visibility is essential to marketing yourself. The other day a reader sent me a long email asking how he could market himself as a technical writer. As a 29-year-old trying to break into the profession, he wanted to establish himself as a technical writer and find a job. Although you can market yourself by attending STC events, publishing in newsletters, passing out business cards, creating a portfolio, and so on, blogging actively about a specific topic probably gives you the most leverage.</p>
<p>The more you blog, the more visible you become. And as your visibility increases, you receive a greater number of invitations. I also serve on the STC Intercom advisory panel. With a small group of other technical communicators, we give suggestions and ideas to the Intercom editors about topics and writers for upcoming Intercom issues. I noticed that when I sit down and try to think about who would be good to write about X, bloggers come to mind first, simply because they are more visible.</p>
<p>So there you have it. Blogging = Visibility and Visibility leads to increased Invitations.</p>
<p>There is one other element at play here: Time. With all these factors (blogging, visibility, and invitations), your amount of Time always decreases, unfortunately.</p>
