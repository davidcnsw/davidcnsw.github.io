<p>I noticed lately that my site has been taking a long time to load. You can check your loading time at <a href="http://tools.pingdom.com/" target="_blank">Pingdom Tools.</a> It took about 12.5 seconds to load the site! Holy smokes, I can't have that. </p>
<p>I resized all my sidebar graphics and added a "Read more" tag before any pictures in posts. </p>
