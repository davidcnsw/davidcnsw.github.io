<p><a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/09/06/losing-its-religion-the-new-york-times-compromises/">Techcrunch says</a> the New York Times' ethics policy of distance and objectivity contradicts their acceptance of <a href="http://davidpogue.com/" target="_blank">David Pogue</a> as an Apple fan boy. Journalists must maintain more distance and objectivity. This criticism reminds me of the case of Chez Pazienza, a CNN blogger fired for expressing views on his blog that contrasted with CNN's more conservative outlook. This is perhaps a subtle danger of blogging: holding views on your personal blog that conflict with your company's views. I wasn't that familiar with Chez, but certainly Pogue is far too popular and engaging for the New York Times to ever consider getting rid of without a huge media backfire.</p>
