<p>I recently helped added some map functionality to a blog focused on <a href="http://www.johnsonteamrealestate.com/blog/" target="_blank">Bellingham real estate</a> to give users a better sense of the various neighborhood locations in their area. I used the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/xml-google-maps/">Google XML maps plugin</a> because it seemed to work best, and ever since then I've been playing with <a href="http://maps.google.com" target="_blank">Google maps</a>.</p>
<p>Mapping technology has come a long way in the last several years. You can now embed a rich Google map directly into your blog or site, draw boundaries on the map, add landmarkers, and so on -- all without almost any technical knowledge. Here's a map of the area I work in downtown Salt Lake City. Click on each of the squares to read a little blurb about that area.</p>
<p><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=103269556943571497995.00046dc703e125f09ad99&amp;ll=40.770792,-111.891675&amp;spn=0.005249,0.013937&amp;t=h&amp;z=17" target="_blank">Where I work</a></p>
<p>I don't use maps much in my job as a technical writer, but maps are commonly used in just about everything else. Every time you have a meeting (for example, an STC meeting), you can embed a Google map on the website. If you have a garage sale, embed a map to your house. Planning a barbecue? Embed a map to the park or area you're having it. I biked a long trail this weekend that I'm eager to add to Google maps. I also have a friend who geomaps trails all the time.</p>
<p>Google maps are fun to play with. To create your own boundaries, go to <a href="http://maps.google.com">http://maps.google.com</a>, sign in, and click <strong>My Maps</strong>. Then click <strong>Create a New Map</strong> and draw the appropriate boundaries with the available tools.</p>
<p>To embed your custom Google map on your blog, install the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/xml-google-maps/">Google XML maps plugin</a>, configure the settings, and then just add a link to your custom map (on your custom map, click the link button in the upper-right to get the link to the map). The plugin automatically converts the link into an embedded map.</p>
<p>The ease of inline maps with WordPress is quite cool. I can imagine a ton of situations where the map can make it easy for people to understand directions and locations -- much more than the antiquated way of providing an address and letting people unfold a giant paper map.</p>
