<p><a href="http://newsweaver.ie/gerrymcgovern/e_article001475250.cfm">Secrecy versus openness in communication</a>. Gerry McGovern makes an interesting comparison between Apple and Microsoft when it comes to secrecy and transparency. Although many people love Apple and find their applications simple to use, they are not a very transparent company at all. They maintain absolute secrecy until the day of release. Not so with Microsoft.</p>
