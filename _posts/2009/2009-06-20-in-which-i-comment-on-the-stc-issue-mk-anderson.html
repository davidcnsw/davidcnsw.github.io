<p><a href="http://www.mkanderson.com/portal/archives/768">In Which I Comment on the STC Issue — MK Anderson</a>. Keith Anderson offers his perspective on the STC financial crisis, arguing that the problems started years ago. He also suggests that the focus should be on user experience. I think his point about the problems developing years ago is especially on target.</p>
