<p>Dealing with information overload can be a huge stressor in life. Not only trying to keep up with the constant deluge of information that comes at you daily, but also managing that information in an organized way -- so that you can find and implement it -- can put your sanity in question. In this podcast, I talk with Ricardo Amigo, a translator in Costa Rica, about different ways to manage information overload. We cover a few of the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal information management</li>
<li>Keeping found things found</li>
<li>Organizing by clips</li>
<li>Organizing by wikis</li>
<li>Other tools to deal with information overload</li>
<li>Finding time to get things done</li>
<li>Podcasts as a tool for keeping up</li>
<li>Email jail</li>
<li>Leadership in information overload</li>
</ul>
