<p>If you're a college student looking to become a technical writer after you graduate, you face a formidable challenge: you can't get a job without experience, and you can't get experience without a job. Especially in a competitive job market, getting a job as a technical writer directly after you graduate -- without a foundation of previous jobs, experience with a handful of tools, and an impressive portfolio -- can be especially difficult. However, if you follow these seven steps, which are not easy, not something you can do overnight, you will find a job.</p>
<p>Note: In a couple of weeks I'm giving a presentation to <a href="http://www.byui.edu/" target="_blank">Brigham Young University Idaho</a> students with this post's topic (getting a job as a technical writer). My presentation is part of their annual professional writing conference. Oct 09 update: Here's <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2009/12/26/get-a-job-in-technical-writing-podcast/">a recording of the presentation</a>.</p>
<p>Last week on Twitter I asked my followers what advice they would give to students on finding a job in technical writing. Here are the responses:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><a href="http://twitter.com/plaindocs">plaindocs</a>: </strong>Show that you are interested in learning about everything!</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://twitter.com/floldun">floldun:</a></strong> Advice: emphasize what you can do for the company, and know what they need (read and ask around), instead of what you want.</p>
