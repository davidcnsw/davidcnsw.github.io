<p><a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Teach-Naked-Effort-Strips/47398/">All the money spent on making classrooms</a> smart and high tech is basically a waste, since students find these formats boring. What really engages people is discussion and participation. Teachers should strip out all the "smart" gear and reformat the classroom back to the same structure that existed in Athens.
