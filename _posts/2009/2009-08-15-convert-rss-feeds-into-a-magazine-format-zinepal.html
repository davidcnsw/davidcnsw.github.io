<p><a href="http://www.cleverhamster.com/clever_hamster/2009/08/zinepal-ondemand-magazine-formatting-of-online-documentation.html">Zinepal is a service</a> that takes your RSS feed and automatically converts it into newsletter/magazine-like PDF or Kindle format. This would be great for chapters who still send out paper newsletters that pull content from their blogs.</p>
