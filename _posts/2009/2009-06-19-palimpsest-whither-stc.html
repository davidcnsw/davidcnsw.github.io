<p><a href="http://www.scriptorium.com/palimpsest/2009/06/whither-stc.html">Palimpsest: Whither STC?</a> Sarah O'Keefe provides an excellent analysis of the financial meltdown that is troubling the STC right now. Her point about the lack of community struck me as the most critical factor. The STC is operating with a 30-year-old model. They need to come up to speed--and quick. The organization has been more reactive than proactive with regards to web 2.0 technology. It needs a champion that could bridge, create, and foster virtual communities. I predict major changes or complete dissolution.</p>
