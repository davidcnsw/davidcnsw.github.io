<p>One of Flare's shortcomings is the inability to easily embed video files. However, if you use the Camtasia Studio's Express Show format as your video format (and you choose the SWF option), you can insert the video into Flare by inserting the video as if it were a picture. Here's a two-minute screencast showing the processing for inserting a video into Flare. You can also put the video in a drop-down hotspot. </p>
