<p><a href="http://radio.lds.org/eng/programs/everything-creative-episode-7">This podcast interview with a professional organizer</a> is fascinating. In Hebrew, the word "create" is the same as the word "organize." Organization clears your mind and enables you to be more creative. Listening to this podcast made me want to clean my house and organize my closets.</p>
