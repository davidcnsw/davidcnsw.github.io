<p><a href="http://www.farbey.co.uk/index.php/2009/08/technical-writer-and-proud-of-it/">I enjoyed David Farbey's post</a> on the name we should call our profession. Aligning our name with the most profitable business model makes sense. If you look at indeed.com for jobs as a "<a href="http://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=technical+communicator&amp;l=" target="_blank">technical communicator</a>," you won't find hardly any. Look for "<a href="http://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=technical+writer&amp;l=" target="_blank">technical writer</a>" and you find a ton. So what is the benefit of calling ourselves technical communicators, when no one is hiring technical communicators?</p>
