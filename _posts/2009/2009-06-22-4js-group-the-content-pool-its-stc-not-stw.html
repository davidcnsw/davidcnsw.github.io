<p><a href="http://4jsgroup.blogspot.com/2009/06/its-stc-not-stw.html">4J's Group - THE CONTENT POOL: It's STC not STW</a>. Alan Porter comments on the STC issue and argues that we don't focus enough on the visual communicators--the graphic designers and illustrators. The STC really only targets the technical writers. In a world where visual information is in increasing demand as a means of technical communication, excluding the visual communicators is one way we hold ourselves back.</p>
