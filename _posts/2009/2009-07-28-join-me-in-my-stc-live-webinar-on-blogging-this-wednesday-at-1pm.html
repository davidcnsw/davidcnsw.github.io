<p>I'm giving an STC webinar on blogging this Wednesday, July 29, from 1:00 to 2:30 p.m. ET. Here's <a href="http://stc.org/edu/seminars01.asp" target="_blank">the title and description</a>:</p>
<p><strong>Converting Readers from Casual Subscribers to Devoted Followers: Best Practices for Blogging</strong></p>
<p>Although many people feel blogging is an activity with no best practices or rules—you publish what you want, when you want, and how you want—these same bloggers usually crave readership, comments, and visibility. They want to have successful blogs that connect with a wide audience in an influential way. Making your blog influential, however, with readers who are more than just casual subscribers but who are actual devoted followers, requires you to give consideration to some best practices for blogging. Beyond search engine optimization, readability, and format, these best practices include crafting posts with story, revealing appropriately, and connecting with users through an engaging voice.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://access.stc.org/imispublic/Core/Events/eventdetails.aspx?iKey=WEB0729" target="_blank">register for the webinar here</a>. Cost is $79.</p>
<p>Webinars differ from podcasts in interactivity. With podcasts, you listen for the length of the show and then submit any questions through e-mail or comments. But with webinars, you can ask questions at any time and receive immediate answers.</p>
