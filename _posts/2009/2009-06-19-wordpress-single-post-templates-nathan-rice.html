<p><a href="http://www.nathanrice.net/blog/wordpress-single-post-templates/">WordPress Single Post Templates — Nathan Rice</a>. If you're customizing a WordPress theme with different templates, you probably know you can create templates specific to different categories. But when the user clicks the post, the single.php file template loads. By default, you can't use different single.php files in the same way that you can with category templates. The script on this site allows you to add a little snippet of code to functions.php so that your single.php file can be templated like category.php.</p>
