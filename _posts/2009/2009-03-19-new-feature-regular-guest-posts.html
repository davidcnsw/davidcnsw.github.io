<p>If you're interested in writing a guest post for I'd Rather Be Writing, I've added a page of requested topics. See the <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/guestposts">Guest Post Topics</a> button on the navigation bar. I've been meaning to feature more guest posts for a while now. It's a great way to increase community involvement, provide more regular content on I'd Rather Be Writing, and give visibility to others. Also, if you're not writing for any other venue, this is a space where you can reach a sizable audience.</p>
<p>Feel free to <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/contact">contact me</a> before you write a guest post, if you want.</p>
<p>(Note that if the content is weak or if the post is a hidden sales pitch for your products, I may not publish the guest post.)</p>
