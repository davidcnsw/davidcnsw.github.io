<p><a href="http://knol.google.com/k/jeffrey-macintyre/content-strategy/2s8csiaptctgg/2#">Content Strategy - a knol by Jeffrey MacIntyre</a>. Looking to get up to speed on content strategy? This page contains a sizable collection of links, references, definitions, and other useful information as a primer to the field. Content strategy is pretty cool. In general, it refers to making careful decisions about all the content on your site to achieve a calculated end with the user. Again, thanks <a href="http://tc.eserver.org/" target="_blank">tc.eserver.org</a> for the tip. (By the way, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knol" target="_blank">"knol"</a> is a new word you can add to your vocabulary.)</p>
