<p><a href="http://philip.greenspun.com/writing/changed-by-web-and-weblog">How the Web and the Weblog have changed Writing</a>. I saw this on <a href="http://www.g2meyer.com/usablehelp/singles/539.html">Gordon Meyer's blog</a>. It talks about how blogs and web publishing have provided venues for texts that, due to incorrect page length, wouldn't have otherwise been published. Traditionally, texts had to be either 5 pages for magazines or 200 pages for books. Blogs now allow paragraph-length thoughts or 20 pages essays. Length (either too long or too short)Â  is no longer a deterrent to publishing.</p>
