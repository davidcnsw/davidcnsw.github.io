<p>In this podcast, <a href="http://scriptorium.com/palimpsest/" target="_blank">Sarah O'Keefe of Scriptorium Publishing</a> explains the results of their recent survey about the state of structured authoring in technical communication. In the survey, they found that 84% of respondents are either thinking of moving to structured authoring, are in the process of moving to structured authoring, have already adopted structured authoring, or are undecided. Only 16% of respondents said they were not moving to structured authoring. She also discusses other survey results, such as the adoption of DITA and mistakes people make in moving to structured authoring.</source></audio></p>
