<p><a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/articles-not-blogs.html">Write Articles, Not Blog Postings (Jakob Nielsen's Alertbox)</a>. I saw this link from <a href="http://www.ivanwalsh.com/2009/06/do-long-posts-generate-more-traffic/" target="_blank">Ivan Walsh</a>. Jakob Nielsen argues that you should write long, in-depth articles on your blog rather than short posts that mostly link to other blogs. If you publish articles, you provide value to your readers and better establish your brand.</p>
