<p><a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2009/04/toward-content-quality.php">Toward Content Quality :: UXmatters</a>. In this article, Colleen Jones explains about ten specific principles that content strategists look at. This article does a nice job of making content strategy more practical (rather than a nebulous, hard to grasp concept). According to Jones, these are the points (beyond mere grammar and style) that a content strategist looks at: "<span>testing content with users</span>, <span>monitoring content metrics</span>, <span>establishing governance,</span> <span>applying the publishing model to content</span> <span>, incorporating content guides, standards, and tips into CMS workflows</span>, <span>maintaining the metadata</span>, <span>hiring employees, consultants, and agencies who care about content."</span></p>
