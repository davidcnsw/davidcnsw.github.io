<p>I'm passing along a survey on behalf of <a href="http://thecontentwrangler.com" target="_blank">The Content Wrangler</a> and <a href="http://www.millenniumci.com/" target="_blank">Millennium Consultants</a>. They're trying to reach Framemaker users who want more integration with EMC Documentum.</p>
<blockquote><p>If you use FrameMaker as an authoring tool and Documentum as your content management system, take this brief survey and see if you quality for a test drive of Linked2, a plug-in to FrameMaker which acts as a bridge between FrameMaker and Documentum Server.</p>
<p>Using Linked2 for Adobe FrameMaker, users can perform the following functions — login, checkin, checkout, view, search and cancel checkout — all from with FrameMaker. And, Linked2 provides users with the ability to reuse DITA XML chunks and graphics, and it supports conrefs, xrefs, hrefs and other content reuse capabilities.</p>
<p>What are you waiting for? <a href="http://survey.constantcontact.com/survey/a07e2l1lb2ufzyhncbd/start" target="_blank">Take the survey</a> and see if you qualify for a free test drive.</p></blockquote>
