<p>I spent much of last week with my head inside a Mediawiki skin (when I probably should have been working on another project). I'm not entirely sure what it is, but I sometimes get fixated by technical problems I can't seem to solve.</p>
<p>I first customized the FraternalRelief Mediawiki skin to match my organization's home page. My customization wasn't too bad, but I saw a few errors, and when I queried a forum, they told me FraternalRelief was no longer compatible with the current version of Mediawiki. Who would have thought. </p>
<p>Fine. I found a compatible <a href="http://paulgu.com/wiki/Home">Paul Gu theme</a> and customized it again to match my organization's site. But during a design review meeting with my team, I brought up the fact that the theme was licensed under GPL. I don't understand the finer details of GPL, but the thought crossed my mind that perhaps GPL would require me to make my customization available to the world. A Mediawiki forum moderator said that would only be the case if I were trying to <em>distribute</em> the skin -- then I would have to give it away for free. But still, I wasn't sure. </p>
<p>Then another team member brought up another point. He said my customization should either look exactly like the original site or it should be noticeably different. No cheap knock-offs or it will throw readers off. I had to agree.</p>
<p>So after the meeting I commenced to pull apart the default Mediawiki skin (Monobook) piece by piece in an effort to understand it. I copied over the stylesheets and layout of the page I was trying to match. And then one by one I copied over chunks of Mediawiki PHP code, trying to understand what each code snippet does.</p>
<p>I copied the source code of the organization page I was attempting to clone. I downloaded all the stylesheets. I pulled down about two dozen images referenced in the stylesheet. I then commenced to integrate the code into the Mediaskin. After about a day and a half, I finally cloned it.</p>
<p>The problem is, Mediawiki has tons of additional components that a regular website doesn't. This is what most people don't understand when they want to convert their regular HTML website to WordPress -- wordpress has a lot more components, each with unique styles. And some of the components only appear at certain times, under certain conditions. So while I cloned my organization's page into a Mediawiki skin, I also have many styles that I need to create. (I wish I could show a screenshot here, but I can't since it's behind the firewall.)</p>
<p>I am starting to like working with Mediawiki as much as I like working with WordPress. Last week the world could have disintegrated around me, and I wouldn't have noticed or even pulled myself away to look.</p>
<p>I don't get fixated with writing help topics in the same way. Mostly writing helps topics is a chore. It's not what I wake up dying to do. But to design the skin, the frame around which the content will display, that's the fun part. It's what I'll do despite all obstacles.</p>
<p>This is not to say, however, that I have aspirations to be an interaction designer. I do love to write. It's nearly 1 a.m., and I couldn't sleep because I wanted to write. But to be free to design and configure the publishing platform for my content is something that, at times, mesmerizes me.</p>
