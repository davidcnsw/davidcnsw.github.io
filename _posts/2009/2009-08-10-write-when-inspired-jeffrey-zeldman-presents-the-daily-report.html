<p>I loved <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2009/08/09/write-when-inspired/">this essay on writing</a>. I always hear advice from writers that you must write daily no matter what. Zeldman takes another perspective on this idea, and encourages you to "write when inspired; rest when tired." Very eloquent prose throughout.</p>
