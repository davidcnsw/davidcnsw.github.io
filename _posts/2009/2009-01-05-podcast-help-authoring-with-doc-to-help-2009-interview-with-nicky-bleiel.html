<p><a href="http://www.componentone.com/" target="_blank">ComponentOne</a> recently released <a href="http://www.componentone.com/SuperProducts/DocToHelp/" target="_blank">Doc-To-Help 2009</a>, which introduces a complete redesign of their user interface. In this podcast, I talk with Nicky Bleiel, who works for ComponentOne, in depth about Doc-To-Help.   Nicky has been a technical communicator for fourteen years and is now a director at large for the STC. I've met Nicky several times at Doc Train and STC conferences, and have interviewed her for other podcasts about <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2008/05/31/podcast-analyzing-your-users-and-needs-before-creating-the-help-deliverables-interview-with-nicky-bleiel/" target="_blank">web 2.0</a> and <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2007/03/25/stc-elections-interview-with-nicky-bleiel-march-25-2007/" target="_self">the STC</a>.</p>
<p>This podcast is sponsored by ComponentOne, the makers of Doc-To-Help . It's one of my first sponsored podcasts, but even though it's sponsored, I've tried to keep my same interviewing style.</p>
<p>In this podcast, we focus exclusively on Doc-To-Help. Specifically, we talk about the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help outputs available from Doc-To-Help</li>
<li>Flexibility in choosing your authoring editor</li>
<li>Doc-To-Help's new ribbon-based interface</li>
<li>Team authoring in Doc-To-Help, including file check-in and check-out</li>
<li>Dynamic help controls available</li>
<li>A sandcastle plugin for SDK and API writers</li>
<li>The appeal of the technical communication field</li>
</ul>
<p>We also cover a few other topics, such as Doc-To-Help's approach to DITA and Web 2.0.</p>
