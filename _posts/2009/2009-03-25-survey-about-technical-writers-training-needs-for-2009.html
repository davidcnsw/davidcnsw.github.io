<p class="announcement">This is a special survey request from Scott Abel of the Content Wrangler. I just took the survey.</p>
<p>2009 is a tough economic year for most of us. Companies are cutting back on nice-to-have purchases and focusing in on what's necessary. This survey conducted by The Content Wrangler (http://www.thecontentwrangler.com) aims to help us better understand your training needs for 2009 and to identify the types of classes you need. We plan to use this information to help training providers create relevant public and on-site training programs that address your needs and to gain an understanding of the current state of training program interest in our industry today. </p>
<p>Participants who complete this very brief survey will be entered into a random drawing for one of the following prizes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A complimentary copy of "Managing Writers: A Real World Guide to Managing Technical Documentation"</li>
<li>A complimentary ticket to the Documentation and Training DITA (June 2-5, 2009) in Indianapolis</li>
<li>A complimentary license to MindMeister.com brainstorming software</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks again for your help. This survey should take less than five minutes and contains only 5 questions.</p>
