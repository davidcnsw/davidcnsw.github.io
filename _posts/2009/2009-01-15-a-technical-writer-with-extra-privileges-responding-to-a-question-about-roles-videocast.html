<blockquote><p>I was doing some career research involving technical writing and stumbled upon your website.  I had a question about that sort of thing, and you seem like a good person to ask. To be frank, I have two main interests--writing and technology.  I love to read and write, but I also love engineering, working with computers, etc.  So, I guess at this point, one would say technical writing is the logical career choice.  Yeah ... but I'm not sure if that would satisfy my tech cravings.  I realize you've mentioned things along this line in your previous posts.  But let me explain a little further ....</p>
<p>Let's say I get schooling in engineering and, say, English.  Would I be able to be a technical writer who also had some extra privileges?  And by that I mean helping with the design process, helping with whatever problem is trying to be solved or whatever item is trying to be created, etc.  What do you think?<br />
Thanks,<br />
