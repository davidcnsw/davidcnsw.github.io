<p>While eating dinner at my mother-in-law's house today, I stumbled across the following curiosity in the bathroom:</p>
<p><figure><img class="size-full wp-image-3507" title="Manual in bathroom" src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/manualinbathroom1.jpg" alt="Manual in bathroom as reading material" width="616" height="816" /><figcaption>Manual in bathroom as reading material</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Kind of an ingenious strategy. A tribute to the cunning intelligence of mothers everywhere!</p>
