<p>I'm giving a webinar for STC community leaders on January 28 titled "Site Critiques and WordPress Q&amp;A."</p>
<p>Here's the description:</p>
<blockquote><p>Because most communities have far more virtual participants than physical participants, establishing a strong web presence where members can find information, interact with each other, and access resources is critical. In this community webinar, we'll review a handful of chapter or SIG sites and discuss what's working well and how they might be improved. If you want to have your site reviewed, <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/contact">send me</a> the URL before the webinar.</p>
<p>We'll also talk about WordPress -- a popular platform many chapters are using for their websites. As a <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/wordpress-consulting">WordPress consultant</a>, I deal with all kinds of WordPress questions, from customizing themes to implementing specific plugins, tweaking the stylesheet, inserting PHP tags, and fixing crashed sites. If you're currently managing or implementing a WordPress site, bring your questions and I'll try to answer them. I'll also go over my top 10 recommended WordPress plugins.</p></blockquote>
