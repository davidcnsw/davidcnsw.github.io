<p>This is <a href="http://www.writingshow.com/podcasts/2009/04042009.html">an informative intro-to-technical writing podcast</a> by Alistair Christie. Great for writers trying to determine whether technical writing is a field they should pursue. It's always refreshing to hear Alistair's perspectives.</p>
