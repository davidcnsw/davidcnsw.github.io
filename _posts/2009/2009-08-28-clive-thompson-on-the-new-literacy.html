<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/techbiz/people/magazine/17-09/st_thompson" mce_href="http://www.wired.com/techbiz/people/magazine/17-09/st_thompson">A scholar conducts a 6 year study</a> of student writing and finds that, despite constant accusations that social media is taking writing downhill, actually "we're in the midst of a literacy revolution the likes of which we haven't seen since Greek civilization." I have to agree -- it is a cool effect that the social web is creating. The world needs more writers.</p>
