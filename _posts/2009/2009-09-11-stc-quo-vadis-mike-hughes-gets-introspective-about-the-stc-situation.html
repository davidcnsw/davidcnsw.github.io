<p>I love it when <a href="http://user-assistance.blogspot.com/2009/09/stc-quo-vadis.html">leaders bare their thoughts</a> in introspective ways on a blog. Hughes has really been grappling with the STC situation and how to handle it. I'm not so interested in possible solutions to the STC problem as I am intrigued by Hughes' use of blogging as a heuristic for thinking. One result is that he gets us on his side, whereas leaders who don't share this same introspective searching don't seem to tap into our support and understanding.</p>
