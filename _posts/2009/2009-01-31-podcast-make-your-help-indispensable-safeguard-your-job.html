Length: 30 min.</p>
<p>In this podcast, I talk with Mike Hughes, second vice president of the STC, about his latest UXMatters article, "<a href="http://uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2009/01/straight-talk-surviving-tough-times-as-a-user-assistance-writer.php">Straight Talk: Surviving Tough Times as a User Assistance Writer.</a>" We talk about how to make help more valuable, more worthwhile and user-focused, so you don't lose your job when companies begin laying off employees based on lack of value.</p>
<p>Here are a few other topics we cover in this podcast:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where help must appear to be used, and how to pitch it to the user</li>
<li>Why documenting everything is sometimes the worst thing you can do</li>
<li>What it means to make your help "a mile wide and thirty seconds deep"</li>
<li>How identifying points of pain and information gaps can help you avoid writing obvious instructions</li>
<li>Why tools and technologies can distract you from the content</li>
</ul>
