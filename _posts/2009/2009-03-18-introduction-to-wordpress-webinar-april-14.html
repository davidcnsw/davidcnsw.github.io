<p><strong>April 2009 Update: </strong>You can <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2009/04/27/recording-of-wordpress-webinar/" target="_self">watch a recording of the webinar here</a>.</p>
<p>I'm giving a <a href="http://stc-suncoast.org/2009/03/21/online-presentation-by-tom-johnson/" target="_blank">webinar to the STC Suncoast chapter on WordPress</a> on April 14, if you're interested. The title of the webinar is "Introduction to WordPress."Â  Here's the description:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you're a writer, chances are you already have a blog or are thinking of starting one. And if you work in technology, most likely you're thinking of using WordPress, the preferred blogging platform for most techy geeks. Starting a WordPress blog and posting content is fairly easy, but the realm of possibilities in WordPress extends far beyond this. <br />
WordPress is a blogging platform that gives you ultimate freedom and flexibility. You can create dynamic, interactive, feature-rich websites styled with the typography, layout, graphics, and design you want. You can embed video, audio, maps, and other media. You can add Ajax effects, jQuery functionality, and advanced PHP scripting. Or you can just leave the site as a simple text-based blog.</p>
<p>In this webinar, you'll learn the basics of WordPress, starting with installation and setup. You'll learn how to write posts and pages, add categories and tags, and arrange the information in your sidebar and header. You'll then learn more advanced tasks, such as customizing your banner, modifying your stylesheet, and changing the overall layout and design.</p>
<p>In addition to the technical how-to, you'll also learn 10 basic principles of usability for your blog, such as the importance of an About page, providing contact information, and making subscription easy. If you already have a WordPress blog, you can also ask questions related to your specific site.</p></blockquote>
<p>Although it's hosted by the Suncoast chapter, registration is open to anyone.</p>
