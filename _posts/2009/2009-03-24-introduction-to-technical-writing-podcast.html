<p>In this podcast, I talk with Ricardo Amigo, a translator and podcaster in Mexico City and Costa Rica, about the field of technical writing. This podcast is more of a reverse interview. Instead of me asking the questions, Ricardo interviews me. The general topic is the field of technical writing, including all of the following: </p>
<ul>
<li> My path into technical writing</li>
<li> Structured authoring</li>
<li>XML and DITA</li>
<li> Information architecture</li>
<li> Usability -- for documentation and software interfaces</li>
<li> Publication formats for help material</li>
<li> Breaking into technical writing</li>
<li> Tools for help authoring</li>
<li> The growth of technical writing</li>
<li> Creativity and technical writing</li>
<li> A typical day as a technical writer</li>
<li> Translation techniques and tools</li>
<li>Simplified technical English</li>
</ul>
<p>Ricardo's company is called <a href="http://www.amigoaudio.com/" target="_blank">Amigo Audio</a>, and they principally do translation. For example, if you need your manual or software interface translated, Amigo Audio can help. You can contact Ricardo Amigo at <a href="mailto:sinpapel@yahoo.com" target="_blank">sinpapel@yahoo.com</a>. Additionally, you can read more about their translation services at <a href="http://www.amigoaudio.com/" target="_blank">Amigo Audio</a>.</source></audio></p>
