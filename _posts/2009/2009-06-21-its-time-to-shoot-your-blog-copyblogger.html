<p><a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/shoot-your-blog/">It's Time to Shoot Your Blog | Copyblogger</a>. In this post, Jon Morrow compares a cowboy shooting a sick horse to bloggers pulling the plug on a sick and dying blog. Shooting a blog is a better analogy than blog-fading, because shooting a blog suggests that you're not just quitting because of a lack of time, energy, or topics, but rather you're quitting because something isn't right about the blog--its focus, the lack of interest, or a non-existent community.</p>
