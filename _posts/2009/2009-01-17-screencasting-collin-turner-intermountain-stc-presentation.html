<h3>Screencasting Presentation Summary</h3>
<p>In this podcast, Collin Turner presents on "Screencasting -- Workflow and Presentation" to the Intermountain STC chapter in Utah. Here's the presentation description:</p>
<blockquote><p>Screencasting (when applied properly) is a valuable tool whose popularity is gaining traction. Most available software is accessible and easy to use. You can make or break a screencast before you ever capture a single screen. This presentation covers the basics of screencasting from concept to publication. This is not a presentation on software â€¦ this is all about planning and workflow! <br />
Collin breaks the process of creating screencasts into five accessible phases:</p>
<ul>
<li> Concept</li>
<li> Pre-production</li>
<li> Production</li>
<li> Post-production</li>
<li> Publication/launch</li>
</ul>
