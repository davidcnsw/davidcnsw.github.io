<p>In this podcast, I talk with <a href="http://justwriteclick.com" target="_blank">Anne Gentle </a>about her forthcoming book, <a href="http://xmlpress.net/publications/conversation-community/" target="_blank">Conversation and Community: The Social Web for Documentation</a>. Anne explains how we've transitioned from the Age of Information to the Age of Interaction, using social web tools to find the information we need. She builds on her experiences with One Laptop per Child, Book Sprints, and her experiences as a corporate blogger for BMC software. In her book, she talks about the future of documentation, the writer's role, community and documentation, commenting and connecting with users, structured authoring with wikis, and more. The book will be published by mid-summer 2009. Keep updated about the release of Ann's book by following her blog, <a href="http://justwriteclick.com" target="_blank">JustWriteClick.com</a>.</source></audio></p>
