<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/21/fashion/21generationb.html">Generation B - Mr. Mom, Father's Day Edition - NYTimes.com</a>. I thoroughly enjoyed this post about fathers. A good barometer as to whether you're involved in your kids' lives is whether you plan their birthdays. Although this editor worked 11 hour days with a 2.5 hour commute, I think tech writing jobs, which mostly tend to be 8 or 9 hour work days, lend themselves to more family involvement. I've got a post I'm writing based on this article.</p>
