<p><a href="http://www.nathanrice.net/blog/10-sites-that-produce-quality-wordpress-content/">10 Sites That Produce Quality WordPress Content — Nathan Rice</a>. Here Rice provides a great list of WordPress sites that publish useful, important information. If you're into WordPress, you might want to add these sites to your RSS feed. Because the WordPress community is so distributed, so is the information. Also, Rice's site has some excellent information as well, but he was too modest to include his own site on the list.</p>
