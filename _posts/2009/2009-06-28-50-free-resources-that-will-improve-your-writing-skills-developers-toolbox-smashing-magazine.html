<p><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/06/28/50-free-resources-that-will-improve-your-writing-skills/">50 Free Resources That Will Improve Your Writing Skills | Developers Toolbox | Smashing Magazine</a>. I appreciate the focus on "writing," but I have to say that these long lists of resources never quite impress me as much as a good post. Also, even though many of the resources here go beyond grammar, I always resent it when people equate grammar and punctuation with writing. Writing is all about content; the grammar is just a given.</p>
