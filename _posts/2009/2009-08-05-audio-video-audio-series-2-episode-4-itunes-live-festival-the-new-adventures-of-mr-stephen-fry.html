<p>It's fascinating to listen to Stephen Fry. He's an extremely eloquent British scholar, filmographer, literary critic, and who knows what else. Listening to Fry feels liberating and exhilarating at the same time. In <a href="http://www.stephenfry.com/media/audio/111/series-2-episode-4--itunes-live-festival/">this iTunes festival speech</a>, he talks about the love of the art and music, and how, even if these lovers of art and music occasionally pirate content, the piracy should not earn them classification as thieves and criminals.</p>
