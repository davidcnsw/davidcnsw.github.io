<p><a href="http://intentionaldesign.ca" target="_blank">Rahel Bailie</a> has started a <a href="http://stc-cs.org/" target="_blank">new SIG focused on content strategy</a>. SIGs are special interest groups sponsored by the STC, involving other STC members also interested in sharing about the same topic. Rahel writes,</p>
<blockquote><p>We welcome the participation of any STC members who are engaged in content strategy, want to develop the skills to become a content strategist, or simply want to know more about content strategy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rahel is trying to bring content strategy more prominently into the discipline of technical communication. Expect a more visible content strategy presence at the next Summit. If you're interested in the Content Strategy SIG, definitely get involved -- they're looking for more people to join the group. You can learn more about <a href="http://stc-cs.org/about-content-strategy/" target="_blank">content strategy here</a>.</p>
