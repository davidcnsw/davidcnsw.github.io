<p>In his controversial post, <a href="http://mashstream.com/mashups/the-myth-of-single-source-authoring/">The Myth of Single Sourcing</a>, Michael Hiatt explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>Single-source publishing is a zombie idea that revives itself periodically and refuses to stay dead. Its zombie supporters chant its purported benefits as a “write once, publish to many” promise and ploddingly follow it as their ultimate goal for mechanized authoring and machine translation. As an object-oriented writing methodology, it is as human as present-day robot technology—good only for conveyor belt assembly or specialized tasks, and always very expensive to implement. Single-source publishing lacks purpose in today's world of information turnover and the dynamic nature of the Web 2.0 moving to Web 3.0 landscape.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, single sourcing your content across the enterprise is an idea that simply doesn't work. I <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2009/11/25/why-help-authoring-tools-will-fade/">responded to the post</a> and had a lively exchange in the comments, so I decided to interview Michael for a podcast.</p>
<p>In this podcast I talk with Michael about single sourcing, collaborative authoring, mashups, help authoring trends, and other topics. You can follow Michael's blog at <a href="http://mashstream.com" target="_blank">Mashstream.com</a>.</p>
<p>(Note: We had a brief Skype issue at the start. The audio gets noticeably better at around the 5 minute mark. It's actually a great example of the clarity that the double-ender recording technique provides instead of just using Skype to record.)</source></audio></p>
