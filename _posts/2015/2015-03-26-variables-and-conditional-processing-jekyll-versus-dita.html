<p>In the <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2015/03/26/misconception-markdown-is-more-limiting-than-dita-jekyll-versus-dita/">previous post</a>, I compared writing in Markdown versus writing in XML. In this post in the series, I want to look at variables and conditional processing between the two platforms.</p>
<h2>Variables in Jekyll</h2>
<p>In Jekyll, you can assign a variable a specific value, like this:</p>

<p>{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}{% assign dog_name = "Fred" %}{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}</p>

<p>Now you can use <code>{% raw %}{{dog_name}}{% endraw %}</code> in your content and it will say <code>Fred</code> in the output:</p>

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}I have a dog named {{dog_name}}.{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Although you could assign this variable directly on your page, it's more common to put the variable in your configuration file. Each Jekyll project has a configuration file where you define your project settings and other build details.</p>
<p>The configuration file is written in YML syntax, so you just add a key-value pair somewhere in the file like this:</p>

{% highlight html %}
dog_name: Fred
{% endhighlight %}

<p>In a single sourcing scenario, you would have a separate configuration file for each output. On your page, you access that variable in the configuration file with the <code>site</code> namespace, like this:</p>

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}I have a wonderful dog named {{site.dog_name}}.{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now if I have 3 outputs, and I want my dog's name to change for each output, I create 3 separate configuration files. In each configuration file, I assign a different value to <code>dog_name</code>. When the site builds, it will use the name assigned in the configuration file.</p>
<h2>Conditional processing in Jekyll</h2>
<p>That's how you would do a simple variable, but what about conditional processing? Suppose you have some content on the page appropriate to a one audience, and other content appropriate to another audience. And the page is common to both outputs.</p>
<p>First, in your configuration file, define the variable:</p>
<p>{% highlight html %}
audience: Mac
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>Now use an if-else statement like this on the page:</p>

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}{% if site.audience == "mac" %}
Your MacBook Pro is going to make you so happy!
{% elsif site.audience == "pc" %}
Thanks for supporting the dying PC industry.
{% else %}
Congratulations on the purchase of your new computer.
{% endif %}{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>When you build with the configuration file where the audience value is <code>mac</code>, it will say, "Your MacBook Pro is going to make you so happy!" And when you build with the configuration file where the audience value is <code>pc</code>, it will say, "Thanks for supporting the dying PC industry." If the configuration file doesn't specific either <code>mac</code> or <code>pc</code>, it will just say, "Congratulations on the purchase of your new computer."</p>
<p>You can get a lot more sophisticated with the logic, combining if-else statements with variable assignments, and much more. This is just a simple taste of what's possible.</p>
<h2>For loops in Jekyll</h2>
<p>Some of the Liquid logic takes you beyond what you can do with DITA. For example, suppose I wanted to show a list of all pages with a specific tag. I could use a <code>for</code> loop to do this directly on a Jekyll page:</p>

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}<ul>
 {% for page in site.pages %}
   {% for tag in page.tags %}
       {% if tag == "getting_started" %}
           <li><a href="{{ page.permalink | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{page.title}}</a></li>
        {% endif %}
   {% endfor %}
 {% endfor %}
</ul>{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>This code would look through all the pages in my Jekyll project and find all those pages that have <code>getting_started</code> as a tag in the frontmatter, which is just some metadata at the top of the page. Here's what that frontmatter looks like:</p>

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
---
title: My Page
permalink: /my_page_link/
tags: getting_started
---
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>DITA doesn't have any equivalent to either tags or a <code>for</code> loop. Take a look at some of these <a href="https://docs.shopify.com/themes/liquid-documentation/tags">other tags available through Liquid</a> to get a sense of what's possible.</p>
<h2>How you do variables and conditional processing in DITA</h2>
<p>In DITA, you don't have variables. Instead you would use a <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/toc_page_level_formatting/variables/">keyref</a>, which you define in the ditamap file like this:</p>
{% highlight xml %}
  <keydef keys="dog_name">
    <topicmeta>
      <keywords>
        <keyword>Fred</keyword>
      </keywords>
    </topicmeta>
  </keydef>
{% endhighlight %}
<p>To access the dog_name, you would write something like this:</p>
<p>{% highlight html %}
I have a wonderful dog named <keyword keyref="dog_name"/>.
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>Suppose you have three different outputs. You could create different attributes on the <code>keyword</code> element, like this:</p>
{% highlight xml %}
  <keydef keys="dog_name">
    <topicmeta>
      <keywords>
        <keyword product="product_a">Fred</keyword>
        <keyword product="product_b">Jack</keyword>
        <keyword product="product_c">Spot</keyword>
      </keywords>
    </topicmeta>
  </keydef>
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>Now you store these attributes in with your build logic. For example, in OxygenXML, you add them in the Editor > Edit modes > Author > Profiling/Conditional Text area. For the <code>product</code> attribute, you would add <code>product_a</code>, <code>product_b</code>, and <code>product_c</code>.</p>
<p>In OxygenXML, when you create a transformation scenario for an output (the equivalent of a configuration file in Jekyll), you associate a DITAVAL file that instructs the transformation to exclude elements with certain attributes.</p>
<p>Here's a DITAVAL file that filters out elements containing product attributes for <code>product_b</code> and <code>product_c</code>:</p>
<p>{% highlight xml %}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<val>
    <prop action="exclude" att="product" val="product_b"/>
    <prop action="exclude" att="product" val="product_c"/>
</val>
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>Now to do the conditional processing in DITA, you add attributes to the elements:</p>
<p>{% highlight xml %}
<p audience="mac">Your MacBook Pro is going to make you so happy!</p>
<p audience="pc">Thanks for supporting the dying PC industry.</p>
<p>Congratulations on the purchase of your new computer.</p>
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>See <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/toc_content_reuse/conditional_profiling/">Conditional Profiling</a> for more details.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Both platforms allow variables and conditional processing in powerful ways. Conditional processing is certainly one of DITA's strengths, but you can do conditional processing in similar ways with Jekyll. And I must admit, the conditional processing seems a bit easier and more intuitive in Jekyll because you're using if-else statements. Variable assignments are much more straightforward as well.</p>
<p>I'm not trying to score the platforms against each other so much here. I mainly want to say, hey, you can do the same things you're doing with DITA using Jekyll. Technical writers don't have to limit themselves to tech-comm platforms to do conditional processing and single sourcing.</p>
