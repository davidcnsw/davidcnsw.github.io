A couple of weeks ago, in a [podcast with Lisa Meloncon](https://idratherbewriting.com/2015/08/10/lisa-meloncon-academic-practitioner-divide-podcast/), I talked about ways to help bridge the gap between academics and practitioners. One way practitioners can help academics is by responding to surveys so that academics can gather the research information they need.

Rebecca Pope is a graduate student at the University of North Texas in Technical Communication. She needs to interview technical editors and writers for a research project in her Digital Literacies course, where she is  analyzing responses to skill requirements in job postings. The interview is 7 questions and takes about 5 minutes to answer.

Here are the questions: 

1. What is your current job title?
2. What are your most used tools? (Ex: Office, Adobe, etc.)
3. What is your definition of digital literacy and how does it relate to your job?
4. What is the most important technical skill you possess?
5. How  valuable is being able to teach yourself new technical skills?
6. What technical skill do you most want to learn or expand on to better help you in your job?
7. What technical skill were you surprised to find is necessary to your job?

If you'd like to participate in the survey, please copy the 7 questions above and respond in the comments below. I posted my responses in the comments already.
