<h2>What do I make of all of this?</h2>
<p>From these top 10 lists, the following are my takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Posts about DITA received the most comments, but DITA-focused posts weren't the most read. This tells me the DITA community is small and opinionated. DITA is also a controversial topic. (Alternatively, I'm an idiot when it comes to DITA, and lots of people stepped in to correct me during the year.)</li>
<li>The most popular posts of all time include how-to information. Instructional material is perhaps the most searched for information on the web. (What a great time to be a technical writer!)</li>
<li>There's a strong interest in technical writing careers, courses, and programs. A lot of people looking for information about technical writing are trying to transition into this field and are searching the web for information.</li>
<li>API documentation is a hot topic for podcasts, but podcasts on a variety of topics still remain popular as a form of information for my audience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on these metrics, here are my plans for 2015:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create more podcasts, especially on API documentation.</li>
<li>Write more instructional how-to posts.</li>
<li>Invite guest bloggers from academia to cover the tech comm program/certificate angle. (Interested?)</li>
<li>Post more tech how-to notes online. I already put my <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/java-introduction/">Java notes on my blog</a>.</li>
<li>Stop posting so much about DITA. I really focused a lot on DITA during 2014. This year I want to focus more attention on API doc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Am I missing anything from my interpretation of these metrics?</p>
