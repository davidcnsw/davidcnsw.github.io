Swagger is a REST specification that allows you to generate interactive API documentation. I created a [tutorial for using Swagger](https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/pubapis_swagger.html) in the API doc course I'm working on.

In my Swagger tutorial, I show you how to use the Swagger Petstore example as well as how to build your own Swagger output. If you go through the [tutorial](https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/pubapis_swagger.html), let me know if you have any feedback.
