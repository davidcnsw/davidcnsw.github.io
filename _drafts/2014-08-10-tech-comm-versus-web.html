<p>I am having fun exploring ways to import DITA content into WordPress. This is a topic I've touched upon several times in my blog's past, but now I'm actually doing it with more effort.</p>
<p>In this post, I'm not going to get into the technical details, which I will no doubt post later. Here I want to note some reasons why I've been exploring this WordPress route. </p>
<p>In the last few posts (<a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2014/08/05/tool-fragmentation-tech-comm-good-thing/">tool fragmentation</a> and <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2014/08/07/benefits-tool-diversity-part-ii/">tool diversity</a>), I've really thought hard about tools. I've been thinking especially about tools because one of my primary goals at my job is to move our content out of PDF and into an online paradigm. It's actually a somewhat rare opportunity, taking and migrating content into a whole new system. Usually doc departments are so entrenched in one tool or system that moving to something new is extremely intimidating. </p>
<p>Based on all of the discussion about innovation and tools lately, here's my conclusion. (Keep in mind that my thoughts often change, especially as I'm swayed and informed by commenters, but here is my conclusion as of today.) The pace of innovation in tech comm will never match the pace of innovation on the web. </p>
<p>About a dozen years ago, DITA was released around the same time as WordPress. IBM introduced DITA in 2001 and the DITA OASIS technical committee was formed in 2004. WordPress was forked from B2/Cafelog by <a href="http://ma.tt/">Matt Mullenweg</a> and <a href="http://zed1.com/journalized/">Mike Little</a> around 2003, with its first official release in 2004. Both platforms are around 11 years old. </p>
<p>Mike writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>From those humble beginnings WordPress has matured into a world-beating open source CMS. B2/Cafelog was used by perhaps 2,000 bloggers. Now WordPress runs almost 75 million sites around the world. That's now over 22% of the web! (<a href="http://mikelittle.org/wordpress-11-years-since-beginning/">WordPress -- 11 years since the beginning</a>)
</p></blockquote>
<p>If you browse the <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress.org</a>, you'll see there are currently about 32,000 plugins and 2,600 themes. Many of the premium themes and plugins aren't included in these numbers. The adoption of WordPress is quite amazing. I've been blogging on WordPress since 2006, and I worked on the side for about 5 years as a WordPress consultant for small projects. I've watched the development of WordPress over the past 8 years. Its growth rate and popularity is astonishing.</p>
<p>Now let's briefly look at the adoption of DITA. First, I know this isn't a fair comparison. In many ways it's an apples to oranges thing. WordPress is a general publishing platform, specializing in blogs and other various websites. DITA is a structured authoring architecture, designed for robust publishing of technical content. Although DITA came on the scene a dozen years ago, the <a href="http://www.ditausers.org/about_us/history_of_dita/">history of structured authoring</a> is much older.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2014/08/07/benefits-tool-diversity-part-ii/#comment-119379">Barry Grenon's comment</a> on my tool diversity post really got me thinking. Barry writes documentation for <a href="http://docs.genesys.com/Documentation">Genesys</a> and is using <a href="http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Ponydocs/1.0/Content/WhatisPonydocs">Ponydocs</a>, a recent fork of Mediawiki led by Splunk. In Barry's comment, he looks beyond the narrow niche of those who call themselves technical writers and instead considers all the people writing help and how-to material on the web. He says,</p>
<blockquote><p>I've often thought that the web is fully a third technical documentation. Between forums for every hobby under the sun, how-to-do-anything-you-can-think-of videos on youtube and so forth, we are all – god help us – become technical writers now! And frankly, I find a lot of the amateur stuff more helpful than professional docs. Amateurs seem to default to simplicity and screenshots. Technical writers seem to default to complexity, an overwhelming and often unnecessary “completeness”, and officialese. And no screenshots due to internal maintenance considerations. (<a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2014/08/07/benefits-tool-diversity-part-ii/#comment-119379">comment link</a>)
</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, although many people aren't professional technical writers creating sophisticated help guides, there are millions of people creating how-to articles for nearly every topic, and they're using platforms like WordPress, which enable easy authoring and publishing and sharing of information, to do it. </p>
<p>After about a dozen years, DITA is only at version 1.2 (with DITA 1.0 and 1.1 being the only previous releases in the dozen years). Meanwhile, web development technology is exploding. You can leverage so many different components (e.g., Twitter Bootstrap, jQuery frameworks, node.js, and more) to produce a wide variety of results quickly and efficiently. </p>
<p>The cool thing about WordPress is that you don't have to be a web developer to get advanced functionality and design. You can pull from a variety of components that others have already built and use it in your project. The tools are ripe for lay people to build rich, interactive sites that compete with products of professional development.</p>
<p>With DITA, there's not nearly the same pace of innovation or free tools to leverage for development. Granted, <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2014/08/05/tool-fragmentation-tech-comm-good-thing/#comment-119141">Mark Baker said</a> he "could not possibly do the SPFE project without the free availability of ANT, Python, Perl, Saxon, FOP, and number of other things." So it's not as if XML developers don't also have a number of tools to leverage as well. </p>
<p>But just look at the contrasting landscapes. I realized that if I want to have a dynamic, modern publishing solution, I need to leverage existing web technologies more than tech comm solutions. </p>
<p>Mark Giffin, another commenter on my tools diversity post, explains why web developers are somewhat resistant to XML solutions:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I work with DITA a lot and I also work with a lot of late-model web developers. My take on their ignoring of DITA is that they find it too heavyweight, plus they have a knee-jerk hostility to XML. 10 or 15 years ago, XML was the official “future of the web,” but that didn't work out, and I think that has a lot to do with their attitude. In tech comm we are pretty much using XML according to its original roots in documentation, like SGML before it. Web devs were using XML for other things, like AJAX programming and heavyweight web service technologies like SOAP. So basically DITA starts in an area completely out of their frame of reference, plus it's heavy and it's XML. Strike three. They also don't do gigantic documentation projects, that I can see. If they did they'd run into the same problems we do with our tools.</p>
<p>All this does not stop web people from talking about “structured content,” and they talk about it all the time. I don't see a lot of evidence that they are making great headway in doing it though. I think the reason for this is that adding real structure to content is unpopular with many authors, no matter how you're doing it. That said, here's a web person giving a bit of praise to DITA recently: <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/battle-for-the-body-field">http://alistapart.com/article/battle-for-the-body-field</a><<br />

<p>I find this split between web dev and tech comm fascinating. I know people will disagree with me about the split. (I'm thinking specifically of my post <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2013/05/14/structured-authoring-versus-the-web/">Is Structured Authoring (like DITA) a Good Fit for Publishing on a Website?</a>, which I ended up re-annotating.) But do you agree that there seems to be a wave of web developers pursuing a certain breed of solutions, and tech comm folks pursuing a different breed of solutions? </p>
<p>Granted, the problems are somewhat different. But again, as Barry says, it seems like a third of the web is how-to content, so the end goals aren't so different. </p>
<p>Well, I don't mean to raise this battle again, but it's an idea I keep coming back to. WordPress is the most vibrant and versatile publishing platform on the web. Why aren't more technical writers leveraging it to publish help material?</p>
<p>Currently I'm trying to combine the best of structured authoring with the best of web development to enable an ideal solution. In my pilot experiment, I have a multisite version of WordPress installed with six different sites. I'm authoring the content in DITA, using OxygenXML, and importing it into WordPress in a regular workflow. There's a lot more to the story, but I'll save the details for another post.</p>
<p>Other notes<br />
- authoring in an online cms sucks. moving things around, re-using contnet, shaping and orgnaizing. much better in an offline editor like oxygen.<br />
- read the a list apart article on the battle for the body<br />
there is benefit in a predictable structure<br />
- publishing has always been dita's weak point. for years, had no webhelp. now there are 2 promising looking ones, but still...</p>
