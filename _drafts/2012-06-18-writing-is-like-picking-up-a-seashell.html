<p>One of the things I love about writing is the ability to explore a viewpoint. To write is to discover, to think, to examine an issue from a new perspective.</p>
<p>In this way, writing is just like finding a seashell in the sand. You find it on the ground, hold it in your hand a while, maybe take it home and put it in your pocket. In time, you lose the shell. Or perhaps you never take the shell home from the beach in the first place. You eye its spiral pattern for a while, and then fling it back into the ocean. Or you paint the shell, or sew it into something, or shape it into a figure or tree of some kind. Maybe you use it as a shovel to scoop up sand.</p>
<p>That's what writing is – picking up a seashell. This metaphor fits writing blog posts well because most blog posts are short enough that you can explore a viewpoint without getting too involved. You hold the shell as a novel, unique pattern for just enough time as your attention holds -- and then you let it go.</p>
<p>I have written about a lot of different topics on this blog. I have held up a thousand seashells and looked at them from different angles. Sometimes I keep hold of the shell, and other times I fling it away. Sometimes I fall in love with an idea and write about it enthusiastically. In time, I shift away from the idea and decide to move onto something else. There's nothing wrong with changing my mind. The fact that I often change my mind suggests that I hold an open mind, always remaining open to new paths.</p>
<p>If you land on my blog and read a post that I wrote three years ago, you may assume that my thoughts on the topic remain the same. Only by reading my posts regularly over time would you perhaps see me shift directions, adopting a new, possibly contradictory perspective in a later post.</p>
<p>That's the path I took with wikis and collaborative authoring – embracing them as an intriguing social technology with endless potential. I held that seashell in my pocket for two years. Then one day, I grew tired of that shell and decided to pick up another shell.</p>
<p>Unless something is working unquestionably well, why not try different paths?</p>
<p>I've tried this route for a while, and it doesn't seem to be working out as well as I'd like. There aren't any overwhelmingly persuasive alternatives, but why not try a different path anyway. Who knows whether that path will turn out to be much more fruitful.</p>
<p>You often don't know what you find until you try it. In trying it out, you learn so much more than just looking at an object from afar. Like the seashell, you see its pattern on the ground. The shell intrigues you. But then you pick it up and heft it in your hand. Only then do you realize its underside is broken, or its edges are sharp. You find that brushing away that sand still leaves the shell looking rough. And so you toss it on the ground and keep walking.</p>
<p>When you change your mind, does it make you whimsical and wishy-washy? You may read my blog one day and see me say X, only to find me saying Y the next month. Does that make me unreliable? Would you rather that my message were constant all the way through?</p>
<p>My blog title is broad enough to encompass a lot. If I had a much narrower title, like Mark Baker's Every Page Is Page One, I wonder what would happen if the tide shifts. What if the real truth is slightly different: The First Page Begins the Relationship, or something.</p>
<p>If you never change your mind about a topic you're writing about, you're not writing in a creative way. Instead, you're typing out what you already know in your mind. Writing is a tool for thought. When you use words to think, you experience the power of writing.</p>
<p>It is not lost on me that my title sings an outdated tune. In a world where writing is commoditized and devalued, when most company leaders think “anyone can write,” and so marginalize the technical writers and their skills, why would I say “I'd rather be writing”? Should I change my mind and therefore blog's title to something else, like “I'd rather be solving problems”?</p>
<p>One day I just might! One day I may decide to throw away this keyboard and pick up a flute instead. And then rather than writing, I would rather be playing a flute.</p>
<p>If we're not constantly adjusting our course, we're not living an unexamined life. The more you scrutinize, the more you question. The more you question, the more answers you consider. And with new answers, it's inevitable that you'll step in a new direction from time to time.</p>
<p>At Confab, Jared Spool said that one trait that great companies have is to reward failure. If you never fail, you never take risks. If you never take risks, but rather stick on the common route, it's unlikely that you'll ever stumble upon brilliant ideas that move you forward in new ways.</p>
<p>I hope this blog recounts with the same energy and tolerance a thousand failures, and in turn, a few really astonishing successes.</p>
