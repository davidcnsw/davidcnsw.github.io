<p>why is it important to take risks? if you stay in a job too long, it communicates the idea that you're not taking risks. the most recent risk taking risks seems to require money. the more in debt you are, the harder it is to take risks. it's hard to take risks when you have a family. you can't just up and move to India with four kids. why are risk taking behaviors seen as so beneficial to a company? makes me think of my ex brother in law who would rack up 10K on a credit card to pursue a business idea that sounded flimsy. i remember interviewing someone who had about 20 yrs of experience at a company. seemed a bit odd, like so many habits would be ingrained  in the person that it would be hard for him to learn a new way of doing things. i took a lot of risks with this move. banking on the fact that career growth is tied to opportunities. what are some major risks i've taken in my life: motorcycle trip across the country. i definitely prefer to be on land more than rock climbing or scuba diving. moving to harlem, right in the thickest part of it. taking out a loan to go to columbia, hoping that the degree would pay for itself. without the teaching stipend, i would have been sunk. i had a plan to write a book and cash it out there. take a risk in having four children. risks in help formats. jump to a new format. settling in to a routine gets a bit boring after a while. there's a balance between risks and routines. if you follow the same routine for 20 years, you're probably a pretty boring guy. if you never find a routine, i don't know how you live. i've taken a lot of risks by revealing information on my blog. some times i hit publish on a post with a sense of hesitation. penelope trunk's strategy was the same notes this wsj article. http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125400159502543783.html Tough as it is for cautious people like me to accept, if you don't occasionally take calculated gambles, you won't get ahead as quickly as those who do. You will also never get over your fear of the unknown, and life will be predictable and dull. http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125400159502543783.html after the layoff, i toyed with the idea of becoming a full-time consultant. then i kind of decided that wasn't my style. there are times in your life when it's better to take risks. make that transition while your'e young. one way to evaluate risks is to ask what the worst case scenario is. a risk -- if your house doesn't sell, short sell it and take the risk of poor credit. Standing still in not an option—not taking the occasional career risk is in itself a career risk. http://blogs.darden.virginia.edu/everettefortner/2009/10/16/take-a-risk-with-your-career/</p>
