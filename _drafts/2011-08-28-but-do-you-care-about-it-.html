<p>In a recent post, I explained my conflicted thoughts about fiction and nonfiction. As a result of some comments on that post, I decided to try my hand at writing some young adult fiction. This is because two weeks ago when I went hiking, I was making up a story to my kids about a rainbow dragon living behind the waterfall cave wall (we were hiking up to Stewart Falls), and I enjoyed telling the story. I thought to myself, this is a lot of fun. Why don't I try writing some stories for kids.</p>
<p>After the hike, I wrote a story about a girl who gets lost in the forest. I won't bore you with the details, but I wrote about 5,000 words before other things took priority. Tonight I opened up my story and read it. I found that I really didn't care about the characters much at all. Nor the story, actually. That's not a good sign.</p>
<p>Part of the problem with writing fiction, I imagine, is caring deeply about a completely fictional construct. How do you learn to care so deeply about a story or person that you just make up in your head?</p>
<p>A colleague at work told me he was working on some young adult fiction, so I asked if I could read it. It's a story about an attic that is tightly controlled by a kid's grandmother. It later turns out that the grandmother is about 500 years old and the attic is a spaceship. I asked my friend if he'd finished writing the story. He said he started it last year and had some character sketches, but he wasn't sure he liked either the characters or story enough to see it through.</p>
<p>Unless you have a tremendous amount of empathy for imaginary people and scenarios, I'm guessing that fiction has to have personal relevance to be something the writer cares about. With nonfiction essays, why would you write about something you don't already care about? The motivation is already there.</p>
