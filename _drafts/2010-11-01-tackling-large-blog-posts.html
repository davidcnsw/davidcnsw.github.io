<p>The other day a developer colleague at work was reading one of my blog posts and shared that he struggles with finishing posts he starts on his blog. When he writes a lengthy blog post (about 1,500 to 2,000 words), he ends up revising and adjusting and editing what he has written repeatedly. Eventually he abandons the post because it never seems to convey exactly what he wants to say. He finds it difficult to manage and orchestrate a lengthy amount of text into a structured argument that he is satisfied with.</p>
<p>He told me this after reading my Being Contrarian post. I'm a little surprised because that post has a bit "stream of consciousness" in it, as my wife pointed out. But in general, I do often write long posts on this blog, and I like to think the posts aren't randomly organized bits of information from a scatter-brained mind.</p>
<p>I didn't have good writing advice for my colleague at the time. After all, writing is all about managing large chunks of text in analytical ways to support a general idea that you're expressing. But as I reflected on his question over the weekend, I realized that the structure and framework for anyone's thoughts is almost always expressed most eloquently through story. If you can structure your ideas through the framework of story, you'll never go wrong. You'll make connections with readers and your posts will have arc.</p>
<p>By story, I don't mean light anecdotes from your personal life. Stories don't even need human actors in them. A story could be how you wrestle with an idea and try to make sense of it. A story is an attempt that meets conflict. It's a yearning or goal that takes you to a conflict. But at some point, the narrator or main idea runs into trouble/obstacles/problems/conflicting ideas. As you wrestle with the conflict, the essay/post/article takes shape. Eventually you come to a point where you resolve the conflict and then wrap things up. Those are the bare bones of a story framework that will see you through a content problem every time.</p>
<p>If I can offer one more tidbit of advice, it's how to start the story. Because a blog is a professional journal, posts usually need some point of relevance to begin. What is it that prompted you to explore the topic? Often that's what my first paragraphs are about. This is a good place to begin with an anecdote, because the point of relevance is usually initiated by a story of some kind. Not always, but sometimes.</p>
<p>This anecdote launches you into the issue. Very quickly you should describe the problem to the reader. If there's no problem that you're up against, the post won't have any fuel.</p>
<p>Write about the problem for a while. Address it from different angles. Quote or summarize how other people have tackled or approached the problem (surely you're not the first). After you've wrestled with it for a while, come to some kind of resolution. That's it. That's blog writing 101. Keep the story metaphor in mind and you'll always have map to chart your content.</p>
