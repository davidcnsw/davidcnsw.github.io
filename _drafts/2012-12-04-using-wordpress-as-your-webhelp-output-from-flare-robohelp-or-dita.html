<h2>Install WordPress on a Web Server</h2>
<p>Your server needs to support PHP and MySQL, preferably the latest versions. If you're an Oracle or Microsoft shop only, and forbid PHP or open source solutions, the WordPress install is going to be pretty difficult. The reason I hadn't adopted WordPress earlier in my career was precisely because the technology wasn't supported or allowed by our IT organization.</p>
<p>However, things have changed a bit. Our team now has our own virtual server. It's a Linux server, with the LAMP stack installed. This means it supports WordPress. Our infrastructure team won't support the PHP / MySQL maintenance, but I've learned enough to get by, and there are plenty of geeks in our department who also know PHP. I can install if it I can support it, basically. We have more autonomy.</p>
<h2>Activate the Multisite Feature of WordPress</h2>
<p>After you install WordPress, activate the multi-user edition. In the past, multiuser versions of WordPress had a different branch of code than the normal versions of WordPress.</p>
<h2>Choose the Page Name Option in the Permalinks</h2>
<p>The permalink is the URL. You want the page name option.</p>
<h2>Install the DITA Import Tool</h2>
<p>A few years ago, a smart guy named Mike Little created a tool that imports the HTML output from DITA into WordPress. Later versions of WordPress broke the tool, but the fix to get it working again is easy. Now I've converted the tool to a plugin and optimized it to work with Flare (in terms of links, which never worked well in the original). You can still use the DITA route, but you don't need to. This will work with any tool that produces an HTML output.</p>
<h2>Produce an HTML Output from Your Authoring Tool</h2>
<p>For a long time I thought that the import needed to be specially formatted through the DITA's HTML output. I spent time learning how to export DITA from Flare, then transform it with the DITA Open Toolkit into the web output. I realized that Flare's DITA output didn't support conditions and also freely published invalid DITA (such as allowing an image tag inside a bold tag, or a UL tag inside a UL tag rather than inside an LI tag, etc.). Then I realized that the HTML output is really what matters, not how you got there. The HTML output from the HTML5 target works just as well as that from the DITA to HTML transform with the toolkit, with the one exception that it doesn't include the DITA map. You could make a map if you wanted, but really, you won't need it. The map is a relic of another time period with WordPress.</p>
<p>The HTML5 output is superior in a lot of ways, making links easier and preserving styles. So don't go down the DITA route unless you're producing content from DITA. Just think HTML output.</p>
<p>After you create an HTML5 target and produce the output. Copy the content folder into a folder on your server, and then configure the import settings to pull from that folder.</p>
<p>To get the images to import correctly, do this ....</p>
<p>Although there's an HTML import tool, the HTML2 WordPress import overwrites your posts each time, which means you'll lose all your comments and, unless you completely delete the old posts, the slugs (URLs) for the posts will change. You don't want that. The DITA Help tool fixes that.</p>
<h2>Import Your Content</h2>
<p>Go ahead and import a set of HTML content. If you want, you can also import the DITA map, and the pages will retain the proper hierarchy. However, the whole idea of parent and child pages in WordPress is outdated. You now created the hierarchy through a custom drag and drop menu.</p>
<p>The first time you import your content, you'll have to define the hierarchy using the menu tool, but you won't need to do this with successive imports. You'll only need to change the menu if you changed your table of contents structure.</p>
<h2>How Links Work</h2>
<p>The original DITA plugin made all links relative, even if they pointed outside your site. A colleague helped me change the code so that if the links have the class "MCXref xref," then the import makes the links relative. If the link doesn't have the class, then</p>
