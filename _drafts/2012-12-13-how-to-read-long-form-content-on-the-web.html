<ol>
<li>Find something you want to read.</li>
<li>Save it to Instapaper.</li>
<li>Open your Instapaper mobile app when you feel like reading.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, during a break you check the #techcomm tagged tweets to see if there's anything interesting. An article catches your eye but it's too long to read in a couple of minutes. You click the Read Later bookmarklet on your browser's Bookmark toolbar. Later, you're waiting for your spouse in the mall, and you find a chair. You open Instapaper and read the article.</p>
<p>Here's another example. Scanning your RSS feed, you see an article that you want to read but right now you're in a meeting. You shouldn't be checking your feeds anyway, but the meeting is so boring. You click the Share button at the bottom of the article and Send it to Instapaper. You forget about the article until the next morning, when you wake up earlier and its dark and cold outside but warm in your bed. You open Instapaper and read the article. It takes you 20 minutes to get through the article, but that's okay because you're in the mood to read.</p>
<p>Checking your e-mail in the morning, you see someone has sent you a link to an article they claim you should read. You scan it quickly to get a gist of what it's about, but your busy and have a full day's work ahead of you. You save the article to Instapaper to read later, and then continue working on real projects. Later that night, after you put your kids to bed, you're lying there waiting for one to fall asleep, because they asked you to stay, and while they try to sleep your reading this really long article that you only glanced at in the morning.</p>
<p>I could probably list more examples, but you get the point.</p>
