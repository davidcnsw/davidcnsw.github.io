<p>This is the story of how I became a Mormon. I realize many readers may not care about this. But I find that most people are curious about the Mormons, and I noted in my <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/aboutme/">About page</a> that I work for the <a title="Mormon Church" href="http://lds.org" target="_blank">LDS Church</a>. I think it might be useful to write my conversion story, in an honest and thoughtful way, without offending anyone or myself, and to do it in a way that may motivate others to learn more about what literary critic Harold Bloom calls the "religion of the American west."</p>
<h2>My Parents</h2>
<p>Like most people, my faith starts with my parents. As a lover of language, my father read the Bible with a certain reverence and awe. He liked stained-glass windows and the passion of Christ, but he often switched churches and I'm not sure why. At one time my father used to assist an Episcopal minister, sometimes giving the sermons (this was when I was a baby, too young to remember). Then he became Catholic, at one time encouraging me to become a Roman Catholic priest because they were in such high demand. Later he became Russian Orthodox, and bought some tapes to learn Russian, in part because he loved how beautiful the Russian Orthodox mass sounded. Years later he became Methodist, reading and teaching the doctrine of John Wesley. After he retired he turned Southern Baptist for a time. Sometimes he dismissed them all and preferred to stay home.</p>
<p>My father frequently boasted how our ancestors traced back to the eleventh-century Hildegard of Bingen, a German nun imbued with the gift of music. Every time I listen to Hildegard, with the flowing polyphones and mystical melodies, I wonder if in some scraggly family tree I connect back to her village.</p>
<p>My mother grew up in a small Kansas town attending an Episcopalian church every Sunday with her mother, the organist for her church. Her mother lived next door to the church and even donated her land to the church when she died. For some reason regular church attendance never stuck deep with my mother. If pressed for a denomination, she would say she is a Trinitarian, but I never remembered her reading the Bible or telling me its stories. Still, she's the kind of person who donates more to the needy than most Christians. She has more patience and generosity and concern for others than I will ever have. I guess she absorbed Christian ethics more than the Christian doctrine.</p>
<h2>First Exposure to Religion</h2>
<p>I grew up in a small town in Washington, about an hour south of Canada. Growing up, I was good friends with the son of a Christian pastor and sometimes attended his church (called the “Church of Christ”). The sermons of Lance's dad, a mild-mannered, ice-cream-eating man with a pot belly, included intense moments of speech that would distort the microphone with static and spit as he became enthusiastic about putting on the <em>shield of righteousness</em>, the <em>sword of truth</em>, the <em>helmet of prayer</em>, and other symbolic Christian protection.</p>
<p>I didn't care much for his messages, but I did enjoy the intermittent singing, the jubilant hymns. I found them refreshing and uplifting. After the meetings ended, when the members of the congregation departed, my friend and I slid his father's church keys up and down the aisles, drank the holy grape juice in the church refrigerator, and ate the communion wafers in the kitchen cupboards.</p>
<h2>Searching in a New City</h2>
<p>A few years after my parents divorced, my father stayed in the small town while my mother and I moved two hours south to a larger city. Feeling alone in the new city, and remembering the good times I had with my friend Lance in his church, I told my mother I wanted to find a church. She agreed to help. She was always supportive in that way.</p>
<p>I picked out several nearby churches and asked her to accompany me. First we went to the Presbyterians, and then the Baptists, and then the Church of Christ. These were all good churches, but I was always distracted by some element I disliked, such as a talk about suggested donations, or people shouting amen and hallelujah.</p>
<p>My mother, the chauffeur, quietly drove me around, not expressing any preferences about faith except that she discouraged Catholicism for its policy against birth control. Her philosophy was to make me happy, provided I steered clear of drugs and alcohol.</p>
<p>About this time I met my first Mormon. He was not a missionary in a shiny suit wandering along the sidewalk with his companion. He was a boy about my age. I first saw him practicing his tennis serve on the side of a court in our apartment complex. He looked normal, with blond-hair and pale skin.</p>
<p>I didn't know he was Mormon then, but nearly every day after I met Mike, beneath four towering apartment buildings with balconies, we bashed a fuzzy green ball back and forth until we could no longer see because of nightfall. He often cracked his racket in anger, and I often hit the ball over the fence, but these problems never happened on Sundays, because Mike didn't play tennis on Sundays.</p>
<h2>First Time in Mormon Church</h2>
<p>One Sunday Mike invited me to his church. The Mormon chapel stood on a hill overlooking the nearby Puget Sound. The chapel, made of red brick, consisted of a large indoor room surrounded by a hallway that contained dozens of classrooms. All the walls were plain and white, without any icons or statues.</p>
<p>The halls and foyer were filled with children -- dozens of young girls in brightly colored dresses, young boys wearing ties of various lengths. They looked like model children except when they broke free and raced recklessly around the halls.</p>
<p>Inside the chapel area, rows of long padded pews were lined up, as they are in most churches, except that, strangely, there was no cross or mural of Christ beyond the wooden pulpit -- just a white wall to look at. It was a staggered white wall with light shining from behind. I think the recessed light was intended to seem as if heaven, or something very bright, was just beyond the wall.</p>
<p>It seemed to me that Mormons valued function more than form. Paintings and sculptures were perhaps “unnecessary.” Maybe they were distracting, or maybe they were graven images -- it wasn't clear to me. Basketball hoops in holy places made the church friendlier, offering us a free-throw line to shoot from as well as a pew to worship in.</p>
<p>The first meeting I attended was a fast and testimony meeting. Whoever wanted to speak could walk up to the pulpit and take as much time as he or she desired bearing his or her testimony. Sometimes the testimonies were drowned in the tears of the speakers, and I wished they would compose themselves and say what they got up there to say. But I at least liked the idea that one could have a testimony.</p>
<p>I greatly anticipated the hymns but found them so slow and dour that I almost stopped singing in amazement that those around me could go along at the funereal pace. The hymns, I later learned, were mostly from the nineteenth century, the lyrics often altered from pre-existing tunes to suit Mormon doctrine. The slow pace was a let-down, though my friend reassured me that the organist was simply playing the meter slowly.</p>
<p>Despite the hymns, I was quickly introduced to more than fifty smiling people who all welcomed me heartily. Enthusiastically shaking my hand, the members introduced their family members, who likewise shook my hand. I shook hands with so many people that first day my hand started to ache.</p>
<p>With just a few exceptions, almost everyone was divided into family units. It seemed like these families had love; they were solid and traditional. They weren't perfect families -- as I learned when I visited some. But they were together families, working to stay together, and as my own parents had run a different course, I was intrigued by a church that could keep families together.</p>
<p>In the following Sundays, when I showed up to church alone, a different family invited me to sit with them, adopting me for the meeting. I appreciated the gesture but always felt a bit like an adopted orphan. I often preferred to sit alone.</p>
<h2>The Missionaries</h2>
<p>After I'd been to church a few times, my friend asked if I would hear the missionaries. I felt I couldn't say no.</p>
<p>The missionaries were dressed in suits and looked mature for their age, sitting upright on the edge of their chairs and presenting their messages with the precision and cordiality of professionals. The two Utah-bred boys were well-groomed, polite, and attentive when I spoke.</p>
<p>During the first lesson one of the missionaries asked a question that caught me off guard. "How do you feel inside?" one of them asked. I didn't understand the question's intent, and I responded that I felt fine. "No," he said, "how do you feel, inside, right now?"</p>
<p>I paused at the question, which required a personal answer rather than an opinion. As I concentrated, I realized that inside I felt as if I were stretched out in a warm bathtub of water, calm and comfortable as can be.</p>
<p>The missionaries had a purpose in identifying the feeling. They believed this comfortable presence during the lesson proved that the things they were teaching were true. This placed a direct challenge on me -- they had offered a logical argument to which I had to answer, if not to them, at least to reconcile the question with myself.</p>
<p>For the rest of the lesson I tried to judge whether my state of comfort was due to a divine influence or due to the couch I was halfway sunk into. I hadn't initially set out to find the "true" church, nor had I considered there to be one. I was ignorant of religion, really, and lumped all churches into one category, believing that there might be a best one, or a church most suitable for a certain person, but not one true at the exclusion of others.</p>
<p>Yet in the process of the listening to these missionary lessons, I became more curious about religion and the assertions the missionaries were making. The idea of church was becoming more than a social community. It was becoming more than just a group to join.</p>
<p>My attempt over the next several days to judge whether the feeling was divine or ordinary probably resulted in my first philosophical contemplation. I replayed the moment I'd been sitting on the couch when the missionary asked how I felt inside. I know feelings are fickle, no doubt connected to one's psycho-biological state. At the same time, they can be quite convincing. There were many variables that might have accounted for the pleasant internal atmosphere, which I would not have noticed had it not been suddenly pointed out to me. There was a difference inside of me, but was it sufficient to arrive at a conclusion? I wanted more evidence.</p>
<h2>Decisions and Deliberations</h2>
<p>The missionaries constantly invited me to pray about the truth of the Book of Mormon, challenging me to take up Moroni's promise. I did pray several times for this spiritual sign to confirm my faith in the Book of Mormon, but I didn't get a hands-down, without-a-doubt-God-exists kind of answer. I mostly received silence and darting echoes of my own voice in my head. But I figured eventually something would come, so I continued with the lessons.</p>
<p>There were six missionary lessons taught over a period of three weeks. The missionaries talked about the Plan of Salvation, explaining that before we were born we lived with God and chose to come to earth where we would undergo trials and tribulations and so forth. The missionaries said other churches were good but lacked the fullness of truth. "They're like a piano with some missing keys," they said.</p>
<p>I didn't know how to respond to it all, but one thing was for certain: whereas before I was ignorant about the world of religion, I was now being drawn into it. This idea of the Holy Ghost, was it real? Could one prove something through feelings rather than reason?</p>
<p>At this time I was in high school taking biology and learning about Darwin's theories of human evolution. Our teacher offered us extra credit for reading <em>The Origin of Species.</em> I took advantage of the opportunity, and soon the question of my origin began to occupy me. I wanted to know, as I suppose everyone does as some point, whether I came from a heavenly abode or from a worm in a cesspool.</p>
<p>I hadn't initially set out to probe questions of origin, but now I thought about them. I made extensive lists of the pros and the cons. The arguments on the religious side were scant and lacked evidence, while the arguments of science had the persuasive power of scholarship and technology. When my construction of lists failed to help me decide, I proceeded to research the matter at the public library.</p>
<p>There was one pro-Mormon book and a handful of anti-Mormon books at the public library. The pro-book offered simple explanations about the wholesomeness of the Latter-day Saints, describing their pioneer trek across the plains, the experience of the seagulls eating crickets, and a general introduction to their moral codes and faith.</p>
<p>The anti-Mormon books, on the other hand, described Mormonism as a "cult," and asserted how horses and compasses and barley weren't in America two thousand years ago. After skimming these books, I drew up a list of questions for the missionaries.</p>
<p>When I presented the first question to the missionaries, they easily answered it and looked forward with eagerness for the next. I felt embarrassed after three questions and wadded up the paper containing the rest. When I asked about evolution, they said ultimately I'd have to pray for an answer.</p>
<p>They were certain I'd get an answer about the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon, if I only asked with sincerity. But praying was not something I did at fifteen. My feeble attempts at it were short, unproductive, and unenlightening. They didn't know how strange it was for someone to pray who has never earnestly prayed before.</p>
<h2>The Book of Mormon</h2>
<div style="float: right; padding: 10px;"><iframe src="http://media.ldscdn.org/book-of-mormon-app/lehi/lehi-160x600.html" height="600" width="160"></iframe></div>
<p>At age fifteen I wasn't much of a reader. I barely cracked open the Book of Mormon and was unfamiliar with the King James language. Most of the reading I accomplished was with the missionaries themselves, who contextualized, summarized, and rephrased the passages to make them more immediate.</p>
<p>One verse that stood out to me was a verse in Alma about a plant: Give place for a seed to grow, it said, and you will feel its swelling motions in your breast. It will feel delicious to your soul. When you feel these good, warm, delicious swelling motions in your soul, how can you say it is wrong? You will know that it is good.</p>
<p>I liked that religion wasn't cold, authoritative, and distant. It could be good, delicious swelling motions inside of you.</p>
<p>Once I asked the missionaries if there were remains of the Nephites scattered about the continent. They said there were, but that my testimony would not come by way of archeology. I later learned that archeological evidence of the ancient Nephite civilization was pretty obsolete, in terms of direct proof, though apparently there is no proof of Jesus Christ either.</p>
<p>At any rate, I liked the Book of Mormon. It was American. It came out of American soil, through an American prophet, and presented a religious history that took place in a much closer hemisphere. The Bible was not only thousands of years old, its events took place on a continent oceans from my own. It was a history of one people in a tiny, distant land. Did the whole universe revolve around that one place? Did God have something against the rest of us? What about the Native Americans while the events in Jerusalem were taking place? It made sense to me, if God loved all of us, that others wouldn't be excluded. A God that excluded some and gave to others wasn't a god worth worshiping. And if the people of the ancient Americas weren't excluded, I felt they ought to have a religious history somewhere.</p>
<h2>Divine Potential</h2>
<p>One Sunday in church our teacher drew a long line across the chalkboard and put a tiny dot in the middle. She explained that our position in life reflected the position on the line, meaning we had existed for eons before, and would exist for eons after. And what awaited us when we arrived at the end of that line? Nothing short of literally becoming gods.</p>
<p>Not just imbued with a sense of godliness, or having charity somewhat approaching God's, but to be actually, physically, totally omniscient, omnipotent, and omnipresent. To be a father children pray to. To run the show, to manipulate the laws of the universe; to organize unorganized matter -- the whole package of deity.</p>
<p>And women? Likewise gods, but female Gods. Husband and wife gods. He, the Eternal Father in Heaven, she, the Eternal Mother. Both equal in power and glory.</p>
<p>This idea changed how I perceived myself. Imagine me, I thought, a nobody, born in anonymity, a boy who had previously lived in a trailer park, now in training to become a god. God wasn't some cold, shapeless, disembodied echo, like alpha waves bouncing off the outer reaches of the universe. He wasn't alone either. He was human, a man; he walked and talked with a divine woman. They had a divine family. And I was a part of it.</p>
<p>According to many critics, this doctrine made Mormons non-Christians. But I could never worship a Father who would have little serfs for children. I started to love the idea of limitless potential.</p>
<p>A church member once told me Joseph Smith was lying on the grass and looked up at heaven and said to another, Do you know what I see? I see a Father, and Mother, and a Son. In other words, the family pattern on earth mirrored the pattern in heaven. This principle changed my idea of who and what God was. We weren't sinners in the hands of an angry God; we weren't destined to serve and worship the megalomania of another being; we weren't divine children handicapped in potential, and we wouldn't be plucking a harp throughout eternity. We would be just like him.</p>
<p>This doctrine filled me with unbounded confidence in myself. If I was destined to be like God, then of course I could figure out how to do calculus. Of course I could map out a route to Texas on my motorcycle. I could do, do, do, man! There was nothing that I could not do, become, or understand without enough effort. I was here on earth to undergo learning experiences that would shape me into a god. If I suffered the pains of stilted romance, it was for such a purpose. If I broke my collar bone, then maybe it was to understand others who had broken bones. My destiny was not to be a servant to God, but to be a God who would be a servant to his people.</p>
<p>I also soon learned another major concept: God was once a man. He had once been a boy like me, but had progressed, "line upon line, precept upon precept" until he reached the state of godhood. This theology was new and different; it was even Whitmanesque. Man was celebrated and deified for a change. A God who progresses from innocence to experience, or a state of boyhood, like I was in, to a state of ultimate manhood, or personhood, must pass through a series of trials; he must continually undergo tests and difficult experiences that will make grow, that will enrich him. God probably got sick and puked with the stomach flu. Maybe he tripped over cracks on the sidewalk while looking at the clouds. Perhaps he dribbled blueberry pie onto his shirt while eating in fancy restaurants. Hell, he probably even swore a few times. Joseph Smith said that if men don't understand God, they don't understand themselves.</p>
<p>To think that I could even begin to understand what was in God's heart, only to find that in mine beat the same emotions -- he could cry, or be happy, get annoyed, or jealous, or be sad; he was full of feeling, maybe he became swept away in ideals, or got discouraged at how everything always failed. God was not different. I was not talking to an incomprehensible being best described as "Other." At my core were the same feelings as His. He wasn't an alien hovering in outer space. He was like me, and if I could understand myself, I could understand God.</p>
<h2>Challenges to Faith</h2>
<p>When my old friend Lance, the pastor's son, learned I was dipping my foot into Mormonism, he asked me to meet with an older brother in his church -- "just to talk," he said. The older brother tried to dissuade me from the path I was following, and his chief argument he tried to stump me with was how God could have once been a man -- upon what earth would he have existed, created by who? Essentially for this doctrine to be logical, God would always require a father, and at some point we must arrive at an original creator.</p>
<p>I admit this is a good question, but no more difficult than the question of who created God. The answer, He always existed, is no better than the answer that each God always had a father. I have since come to discover a plethora of arguments against Mormonism, and while each one seems to shake my faith at the time, with more reflection and study I come to discover that the situation is always more complex than initially imagined, and often neither side can ultimately establish a definitive argument. There are always arguments and counter-arguments ad infinitum, and if one cannot identify a rebuttal it isn't because no rebuttal exists, but because one is not clever or informed enough to create one.</p>
<p>The Mormon theology was attractive and I wanted to believe in it, but I couldn't make up my mind. I didn't know. I didn't know if it was all just a lie, because it almost sounded too good to be true. It placed man at the center of the universe, even the center of God's universe -- we were his entire "work and glory," one scripture said. But I couldn't create a faith out of pretending. I knew I wouldn't be able to return each Sunday pretending that it was all true. What about evolution, and all that evidence? I couldn't trick myself. As much as I might pretend to believe, my pretending would ultimately leave me hollow.</p>
<p>I didn't want to join unless I could make a decision and believe wholeheartedly that it was correct. I wasn't going to get baptized just to win friends or security or whatever else the church offered. It is possible for those who grow up in the church, for those who are cultural Mormons, perhaps to go along with the program without believing the program's events are real, only because the social consequences of leaving are so unappealing that it is sometimes better to bite your lip and endure. But for those without the social pressures, there is not much reason to endure.</p>
<p>Mormons seemed upright, honest, wholesome -- "brothers and sisters," they called themselves, friendly and wanting nothing more than to do right and good. They lived strict moral and health codes, refraining from extra-marital sex or any other promiscuity, abstaining from alcohol, tobacco, coffee, and tea.</p>
<p>Exceptions to obedience existed, of course, but the Mormons I met displayed such admirable qualities that I wanted to be one of them; they must have a hold of something good, I reasoned, because they themselves are good. If they were happy because of their beliefs, then I wanted to see if I too could believe and be happy too. But could I lie to myself? Were they all deceived, or did they each agree to pretend? How did they find the faith to believe?</p>
<h2>Conversion and Gambler's Logic</h2>
<p>I felt I had to decide where I stood in the world, whether I believed in God or not. Science had a dozen cogent points against religion, and all religion had for proof, as far as I could see, or feel, was the Holy Ghost, or my supposed brief feelings of it. I didn't want to lie to myself and pretend that I believed in the Mormon Church if in fact I did not.</p>
<p>I had to make a choice. The two options were not compatible. Either God existed somewhere or he did not. It came down to that. This was no either/or fallacy. And how could I ever know which was right, and which was wrong? Because I had felt a sense of peace during a missionary lesson? This didn't seem sufficient proof on which to base a life of spiritual dedication. The missionaries were prepared to deal with explaining why their church was the correct one, but not why I should believe in God in the first place. In my mind I never contemplated which church might be most correct, because I couldn't get past the first step of actually believing that God existed. If God didn't exist, then no church could be true. But how could I ever know for sure if God existed?</p>
<p>If God did exist, why did he make his presence so ambiguous in the world? I prayed but I didn't know what to say, and I didn't know how to listen, so I visited my Mormon friend and contemplated the happiness of his family, which wasn't really all that happy, but they did things together; they all sat down around the dinner table; the mother and father interacted, smiled, watched BYU football on the couch.</p>
<p>Coming to a definitive conclusion about God's existence, I decided, was a question I could not answer at the time. Indeed it might never be fully answerable. So I made my decision according to gambler's logic: Supposing I were wrong about the inner feelings proving God's existence, what would I lose? Nothing. Because if I were wrong, I would wither away and become nothing, and my decision would not matter anyway, because nothing would ultimately matter. But if I were right, I had everything to gain. So I decided I would try faith.</p>
<p>I told the missionaries I wanted to be baptized. They filled up the baptismal font, which resembled a giant square hot tub, and I stepped into the water. Since even young men can perform baptisms, I asked that my friend Mike baptize me. He said a prayer and lowered me back into the water, and I emerged soaking wet but presumably free of sin.</p>
<p>That was in March, 1991, when I was a sophomore in high school. After high school, I went on to serve a mission four years later, and eventually experienced the flip side of the situation, where I was the missionary helping others through doubts. I learned to recognize and rely on the constant inner feelings of warmth and peace that would fill me so frequently when we taught the gospel. It was something undeniable and mysterious.</p>
<p>Faith, I have come to accept, is ultimately a choice among uncertainties. The questions never get easier. The more I study, the more questions I have. But there are answers, too. They don't come from rational reflection. The answers are whispers on the inside, like the initial moment with the missionaries long ago, as I was sitting comfortably on the couch, suddenly filled with peace, and not knowing why.</p>
