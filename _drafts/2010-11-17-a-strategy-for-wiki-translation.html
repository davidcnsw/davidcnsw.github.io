<p>Wikis are cool, but if you have to translate your content, look out. Wikis pose some problems. Here's a project I'm currently tackling and my approach. If you have a better strategy, please let me know. </p>
<p>Handbook X has about 200 pages of content. The audience consists of about 5,000 users worldwide. Many of these users actively participate in a forum and even have a wiki to supplement missing content from the handbook. Information in the handbook sometimes needs updating and enhancing as the software undergoes changes and new policies are implemented. </p>
<p>Given the need for collaborative authoring and dynamic updates, a wiki makes sense. No one doubts that. The wiki will support dynamic updates and will scale as new products are added that also need documentation. The only catch is that the content for the wiki must be translated into 20 languages. Translation is expensive; budgets are not infinite. If the English wiki gets updated after translation, it will be out of sync with the translated versions. I only speak English and some Spanish. If someone updates one of the Danish translations, I have no way of knowing what the update says. How would you handle this scenario?</p>
<p>Here's my strategy. During the development of the application, get all the documentation from the handbook online in a wiki, in English. Merge the existing "addendum" wiki with the handbook content. Refine and refine the English content until it is solid. When the product is near release, submit the English content for translation into 20 languages. Then implement the 20 language translations onto the wiki (making the translated pages as subpages). </p>
<p>Now, although the content will be translated to 20 languages, 85% of the users speak English, Spanish, and Portuguese (an important detail I omitted earlier). For those three languages, designate someone from the community to be in charge of synchronizing updates from the English wiki across to the Spanish and Portuguese wiki pages. </p>
<p>If someone updates a page of the English wiki, that's okay. Let the English wiki be the most current source of information. Hopefully the community translators will help keep the Spanish and Portuguese content in sync with the English, but if not, it's not a huge deal. </p>
<p>Do not leave the 17 languages open for editing on the wiki. Lock the pages down. Reason being, unless you have someone in each language carefully patrolling the wikis, you won't be able to tell what kinds of updates people are making. Since you can't judge the content, nor can you constantly send it out to 17 community contacts for translation, just scrap attempts to keep these 17 wiki translations in sync. Focus on the big three only. Of the 15% of the people who don't speak English, Spanish, or Portuguese, probably 5% speak English as a second language anyway. Worrying that 10% of the users have the absolute most current form of documentation is unnecessary overkill in the documentation solution. </p>
<p>Every year, send the English wiki (which is the master source) for retranslation into the 20 other languages. Given the translation memory of the content, only parts that need translation will appear to translators for translation. Most like you won't have to retranslate the whole content from scratch again. This will keep translation costs much lower than they initially appear. Also, if you trust the Portuguese and Spanish updates to the content, you can forego translating those versions as well.</p>
<p>There's one final problem to address. Not every user has Internet access. Some are using the old version of the program and need a local copy of the wiki content. Now what? Easy. The groups that need a local copy of the content can receive one, but it won't be as current as the wiki. At the time you send the content off for translation into 20 languages, also compile the English content into a document that you publish as a PDF. Allow these offline groups to download the PDF. The PDF will be updated once a year.</p>
