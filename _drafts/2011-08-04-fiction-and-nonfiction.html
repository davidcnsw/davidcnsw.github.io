<p>The Problem with Fiction</p>
<p>I've been somewhat bothered by the fact that I don't read much fiction. For someone who has a degree in creative writing, this is a bit troubling. My degree is in nonfiction creative writing, but still, you would think that I read a novel a week or more.</p>
<p>Not really. Not too long after my MFA, I went through a burnout phase. During my 3 years at Columbia, I wrote a lot of stories and essays. They were all a type of literary writing. I spent countless hours editing them and then sent them off to various literary journals. The responses took months and were abysmal. I think I only published 1 or 2 of that whole lot.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I was feeling the pressures of employment. I applied for dozens of teaching positions, but nothing came of it except for, by some small miracle, a two-year teaching stint in Egypt. But that job wasn't taking me anywhere careerwise, and the pay wasn't much either.</p>
<p>At some point, I stopped reading fiction because I felt it wasn't getting me anywhere. While I love story, it didn't help me get a better job, or bring in money, and holing myself up somewhere to read was isolating from family duties.</p>
<p>During this time I focused more on tech and on books that would add value to my career than on superfluous fiction or even narrative nonfiction.</p>
<p>Years passed like this. I guess I found that I could do without fiction. Movies fill the escapism void, and travel excursions.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, I kind of fell into a bad habit. After work and general busy-ness, I'd feel exhausted in the evening. Too tired to do anything, and ready to relax and be entertained, I'd watch spy shows (like MI-5), or cop shows (like Rookie Blue), or even South/North Korean espionage melodramas with subtitles (Iris).</p>
<p>The problem is that rather than going to sleep when tired, the shows would keep me up for another hour or two at night. Then I'd be exhausted in the morning. The need for some passive, mindless entertainment at around 10 pm lasted until midnight. By mid-to-end week I was exhausted and sometimes grumpy. I knew I needed to change.</p>
<p>My daughter recommended that instead of television, I choose a favorite book to read. It should be a book I like, with a story that is a treat to read, one that I might look forward to and prefer to television. I knew she was right.</p>
<p>The next few nights, rather than watching television, I pulled out a copy of Dispensation, an anthology of short stories with Mormon themes that Shannon gave me for Christmas. Lo and behold, I was hooked. Soon I started reading more and more short stories, and then expanded to the Atlantic to read fiction there. I downloaded Patrick O'Brian's classic Master and Commander and listened to that while working on the basement. I realized how much I liked fiction. Why had I been avoiding it for so long?</p>
<p>And then I got to thinking about writing short stories myself. I'm creative, I can make up a story on the spot for my kids. Why not try my hand at fiction? Maybe I had a hidden talent that I could surface.</p>
<p>I began brainstorming a plot. But this story, being fiction, had to follow one rule. According to an essay by Bret Johnson in The Atlantic, you shouldn't write what you know. This is the biggest mistake rookies make. Why shouldn't you write what you know? Because if you do, writing becomes an act of explanation rather than exploration. In contrast, if you get inside someone's head, and imagine or explore what they would think, feel, say, and do, then you're operating in another mode: invention, imagination, discovery. And in that mode, your prose comes alive.</p>
<p>I was totally convinced by this argument. In fact, I started to think that perhaps I had gotten the nonfiction/fiction dichotomy wrong all these years. Rather than pursuing nonfiction, I should have pursued fiction. I should have been exploring the minds of my characters; these minds must be unlike me.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I began to conceptualize a story, to lay down the basic plot. I would write about a repressed housewife who takes a "vacation" while her husband tends to the kids at home. Instead of vacationing, the woman applies for a job at a temp agency and ends up, unbeknownst to her husband, filling her husband's job during his leave of absence. The manager likes her work so much he decides to let the husband go and hire the woman full time. This sets the man into jealousy and rage to find out who stole his job, and so on. I would explore the housewife's mindset, her sense of guilt in leaving her children to pursue a career. I would capture her elation at the praise she receives when she excels at her job, astounding her manager The whole story would find a climax in the revelation to the husband about his wife's professional capabilities.</p>
<p>Excited about the possibility of writing this story, I shared it with my wife over some cake at a posh dessert shop â€“ "The Chocolate" in Orem. It's a house with a lot of different rooms, painted in green and black and decorated with mirrors and flowers and paintings. We sat on zebra cloth chairs. I tried to explain the plot to my wife and how it would proceed, and how it would eventually end.</p>
<p>As I was explaining it, I realized how shallow and simple it all sounded. I would need to put a lot more thought and development into the story. I only had the bare bones of a few of the actions, and creating a real story would require a lot more work. More research, more brainstorming, and lots of writing and rewriting and more writing. I estimated that to write one short story that was decent, I would need to dedicate at least 40 hours to the task.</p>
<p>One problem, though, is that writing a perspective I don't know is somewhat demotivating because it is a little irrelevant. In this story's case, I'm trying to navigate my wife's thinking (to a point, but not entirely), so it did have relevance. But not in an overly compelling way.</p>
<p> My wife explained that I'd need to show rather than tell. As I related the proposed plot, her quiet reaction slowed my eagerness, and I began to think through this idea. After spending 40+ hours on a short story, what would I do with it? Send it to a small literary journal, where it would be added to their slush pile and reviewed quarterly? Would it  end up in an online literary e-zine read by a handful of wannabe writers, published by some spare-time literature hobbyist ?</p>
<p>The more I thought about it, the more I realized that writing fiction would be a lot of work. I'd need to research the characters, the psychology, the environment. I'd need to write and rewrite and rewrite. And all for what? For the chance of publishing in some obscure literary journal?</p>
<p>There wouldn't be any immediate reward, no immediate comments. No praise. No career advancement. No speaking invitations. The work would reside in a place few would read, and yield almost immeasurable results.</p>
<p>Worst of all, I realized how simple and stupid my story sounded. This effort? Not really worth it. There was no twist, no cleverness in the story. It would either be predictable or manipulative.</p>
<p>With that, I decided to put the brakes on so much fiction reading. If I were to pour my soul into something, it would be nonfiction, the personal essay, my favorite format. I know what it takes to write a good personal essay. It requires research, and brainstorming, and a lot of writing and rewriting and sometimes throwing it all away to start over. Somehow it never occurred to me that writing fiction followed a similar process.</p>
<p>More than anything, I was befuddled about what to make of the advice -- <em>don't write what you know</em>. in nonfiction, if you don't know the topic you're writing about, your essay is going to stink. If you don't know what you're talking about, you'll shift to narrative your own personal memoirs, which are the sure sign of death. Again, it puts you in the explanatory mode rather than the exploratory mode. Who wants to read a personal essay about a topic someone knows little about? Without that intellectual substance, the essay devolves into the dramatized details of the writer's personal life.</p>
<p>However, this exploratory mode that Bret Johnson describes is, I realized, exactly the thing I like about personal essays. You don't start out knowing everything. The very purpose is to explore a topic, to essay an idea and see where it takes you, or what a thing truly is. It's the same mode that fiction writers slip into when imagining a character, but in nonfiction's case, you're navigating a world of ideas. You're following their paths and seeing where they intersect and cross.</p>
<p>My brief foray back into and out of fiction felt right to me. A relief. A relief to know I hadn't wasted all those years in the wrong direction. In fact, I was even now more sure of my choice to pursue nonfiction than my previous uncertainties.</p>
<p>c.s. on write what you don't know</p>
<p>does this same advice apply to nonfiction?</p>
<p>What does it entirely mean?</p>
<p>Examples of it playing out</p>
<p>Is this a principle of nonfiction</p>
<p>When people give advice to fiction writers to not write about what they know, they aren't suggesting that someone begin writing ignorantly, wholely imagining a person's psyche, going with the rhythm no matter how closely their imagination matches reality. The fiction writer has to move to a position of knowledge before he or she can write intelligently. By the time you write a scene and step inside a character's head, you are no longer writing what you don't know .</p>
<p>The same goes for nonfiction. By the time you're writing an essay, you've moved from a position of ignorance to one of knowledge about the topic. No one writes straight from the muse, without any research, brainstorming, reading, thought, experience, and other understanding.</p>
<p>But with nonfiction, it's a bit different. Many times you can become such an expert in a topic that you no longer have to ramp up before you write. You have passed into the subject matter expert domain .At that point, do you become unfit to write about the topic, similar to the fiction writer who knows the material so well becomes it's his or her own life?</p>
<p>No, the more experience you can bring to the table, the more insight, knowledge, background, and other insights, the better your essay will be. You may lose the spark of discovery, but maybe not. At any rate, with nonfiction it's almost just the opposite â€“ if you have personal experience with a topic, weave it in. If you have stories from your own life, integrate them.</p>
<p>The one fault in writing from a vantage point of knowledge is lack of perspective. You may become blind to assumptions and other elements. You may not see what others clearly see. What others may find strange may have become normal to you.</p>
<p>Perhaps there is a space in which your perspective to write about a topic qualifies you the most. The space is at an intermediate amount of knowledge â€“ when you know enough to write intelligently about a topic, but you don't know it so well that you've become blind to it. You're not writing at such an advanced level that you leave all your readers behind, but you're also ahead of your readers so they continue to learn something.</p>
