<p>I've been reading Robert Horn's book on visual language. The premise is that communication through visual imagery follows enough conventions and techniques that it constitutes a language in an of itself. Horn gets too much into morphology, syntax, other linguistic theory than I want to learn. But I like the angle Horn explores.</p>
<p>Conceptual diagrams do a great job at bringing text to life. If there's one goal I have as a technical writer, it's to integrate more visual language into my deliverables. I'm not just referring to screenshots, but to concept diagrams. As I'm explaining the big picture behind a system, or the process, or some other concept, a visual image helps clarify that topic in significant ways. The clarity achieved through visuals benefits both users and information creators.</p>
<p>Why don't we include more visual diagrams in our help material? For starters, creating a visual diagram is hard work. Technical writers barely have time as it is to finish the documentation, let alone include dozens of hand-drawn images. Another reason is that technical writers generally don't have an artist's skills to illustrate. After 3rd grade, we stopped believing in our ability to draw, paint, or create.</p>
<p>I recently created some quick reference guides that are heavily image based. Working on images is the counterpart to documentation that I've always neglected. Partly it's because I couldn't create the illustrations for lack of graphics app know-how. But another problem is conceptualizing what image can be used to convey n idea.</p>
