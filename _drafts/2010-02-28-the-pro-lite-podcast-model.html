<p>We're used to thinking that information on the web is free. We expect it. But there's a downside to the information-is-free model, and it's not just an issue for the information producers. If information is free, there's less reason to produce it. This is particularly true with podcasts. Unlike blog posts, podcasts take hours to produce. There's equipment involved, more bandwidth is consumed, and the whole process is simply time-consuming. Because of these constraints, many people who begin podcasting start to podfade before too long. Without any revenue, there's not enough justification for all the time you spend producing a podcast to keep doing it. As a result, the audience loses out on the free content as well.</p>
<p>So while we often enjoy the free podcasts that we can download without paying a dime, that well of podcasts dries up without a revenue benefit to the podcast producers.</p>
<p>At the same time, the completely paid model for podcasts is one that few have achieved. A complete subscription model requires consumers to trust the content before signing up, or to be persuaded by listening to one or two audio samples.</p>
<p>The model that seems to make the most sense to me is a mix of the two: the pro/lite version. With pro/lite versions of software, everyone can use the lite versions, but if you want the full functionality, you have to pay a fee. I like this model because it allows you to see if you truly want/like the lite version before committing yourself. For example, TechSmith's Jing offers a pro and lite version. The lite version records in SWF format. The pro version allows you to record in MP4 -- quite a big difference when you consider that youtube doesn't allow you to upload SWFs but does accept Mp4 files.</p>
<p>So I've been thinking about how to apply a pro/lite version to my podcasts. I can keep delivering everything for free. You'll continue to get 1 or 2 podcasts a month in a sporadic fashion. But if I were to implement a pro version, the revenue model would motivate me to record more regular podcasts, producing one a week.</p>
