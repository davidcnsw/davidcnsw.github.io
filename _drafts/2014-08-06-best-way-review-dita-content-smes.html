<p>I'm wondering what others do to review DITA files with SMEs.</p>
<p>You know the scenario. You've worked on new documentation for an upcoming release, and now it's time to let the engineers and product managers review the help content. The problem is, the content is in DITA XML, so it's hard for reviews to read.</p>
<p>Here are a few options for reviewing DITA files:</p>
<h2>Option 1. Push to PDF and have reviewers annotate the PDF and send it back.</h2>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Easy to render a PDF and send it out.</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Content looks like a book rather than website, so the form reviews comment on may not be the form users consume. No ability for reviews to see what other reviewers are saying. Not everyone is familiar with the commenting tools in Acrobat. Can't update the content mid-review -- you can only generate another PDF and send it out again.</p>
<h2>Option 2. Review through easyDITA.</h2>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Intuitive interface and Google-like comments. Has ticketing system to ensure reviewers complete tasks and know which topics to review.</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Paid service. Requires some training. Only one reviewer can edit one topic at a time. Browser-based storage may not be allowed by company's security policies.</p>
<h2>Option 3. Publish on an internal server and review through a browser plugin such as Annotary.com.</h2>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Seems easy to implement on the surface.</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Doesn't work for frame-based output, such as Oxygen's webhelp. Each Annotary annotations are specific to the user and not shared across users. (Everyone could use the same account, but it would feel like using the tech against its design intention.) Reviewers get saddled with browser plugin extensions they probably don't want, which will annoy them when they're no longer reviewing content.</p>
<h2>Option 4. Upload to a source control repository and let SMEs check out, mark up, and re-upload. Get a number of floating Oxygen licenses so SMEs can easily see and add comments to files.</h2>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Fits software source control model that many engineers are familiar with.</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> This method of markup may be awkward for product managers and non-engineers. Tech writers may have to learn source control protocols. Would require lots of merges and diffs. Engineers may be reluctant to download and install Oxygen. Would require some training to explain how to navigate a ditamap to view the files. Users can't see each others comments.</p>
<h2>Option 5. Forego written comments and instead hold a meeting to solicit real-time feedback as you walk through the help topic by topic.</h2>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> People may give better feedback this way. You ensure that conflicting reviews are dealt with in real-time, since the reviewers will be able to interface with each other.</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Hard to corral everyone in the room at the same time. Wouldn't work for asynchronous work models. Discussion in room may be vague and hard to pin down to an actual conclusion with accuracy. Discussions may go off on tangents, such as the most efficient workflow for the application and needed future sprints.</p>
<h2>Option 6. Upload Oxygen's webhelp with feedback to an internal server and let people review the content that way, adding comments per page.</h2>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Inside firewall. Page level comments are tied to a specific page. Users can add comments to a web page, which allows reviewers to see each other's content. Allows you to push out updates to the page while continuing to solicit feedback, which enables you to iterate on the material during the review cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Requires server software (MySQL and PHP). Requires reviewers to set up user accounts (though you could set up the accounts for them). Doesn't allow element-level commenting. Setting up identity access control may be an issue.</p>
<h2>Option 7. Copy to Google Docs and solicit comments through Google's comment capability.</h2>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Easy and intuitive commenting capability. Allows for simultaneous commenting and parallel workflows.</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Google Docs may not be an allowed service. Requires users to have Google accounts. No way to round trip content into Google, so formatting will require manual tweaking. (Although you can upload HTML files into Google docs, you can only annotate content that originates in Google Docs natively.) Hard to push DITA into Google and pull back into DITA source.</p>
<h2>Option 8. Review via an Oxygen webapp.</h2>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Intuitive review interface.</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Requires storage on Google or Dropbox, which may not be allowed storage repositories with security teams. Only one person can edit a topic at a time. Solution new and not entirely developed out.</p>
<h2>Option 9. Publish to Confluence, where people can add comments to files.</h2>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Confluence provides solid commenting capability.</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Requires Confluence instance. Not sure if DITA to Confluence plugin even works. No round tripping back into DITA.</p>
<h2>Option 10. Publish to Word, send out as track changes, and let others review the content.</h2>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Allows for commenting and review capability that many people are familiar with. Provides track changes for history.</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Doesn't allow for iteration of help content during the review cycle. Essentially the same as static PDF review. Doesn't show the content how users will consume it.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I think the best method for review is to iterate on the content during the review cycle. For example, when Sally adds a comment on topic X, the tech writer can update the content right then. When Joe gets around to reviewing the content, he sees the updated topic.</p>
<p>It's also good to allow reviewers to interface with each other. Suppose Sally's comment is vague or controversial, so the tech writer decides not to implement it yet. Joe views the help and comments that Sally's suggested edit is outrageous. Sally can duke it out with Joe while the tech writer waits for one to emerge as a victor.</p>
<p>If you can push out updates to the content while still retaining a comment history, this is also ideal. This way you can show others how the content has evolved during the review cycle. For example, the other reviewers can see that a few other engineers have already made comments, which means they already reviewed it, and the tech writer can respond to each of the comments to indicate the changes made.</p>
<p>The solution that best fits this model is the Oxygen Webhelp with Feedback output. I haven't used this model before, but I think it could be something that works out well for me.</p>
<p>Any thoughts on the best approach here? What actually works?</p>
