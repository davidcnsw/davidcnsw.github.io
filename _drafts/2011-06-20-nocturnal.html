<p>There once was a girl who started losing her eyesight during the day. But even as she lost her daylight eyesight, her nighttime eyesight grew stronger. Every night she could see more and more. She stayed out longer during the night, and would sleep during the day. Her nighttime eyesight grew stronger every day, until she could see just as much at night as she previously could during the day. She stayed out all night and hunted with the cats. Eventually she became nocturnal, sleeping all day and staying up all night.</p>
