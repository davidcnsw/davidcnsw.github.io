<p>I'm not sure entirely why, but corporate blogging is really, really hard. On my professional blog, I can post several times a week in the spare moments of my days, sitting down for 30 minutes here or an hour there and have some substantive content to show for it. But at work, I can spin my wheels on full throttle for hours and only have 1 or 2 posts -- not really interesting ones -- to show for it. Why is that?</p>
<p>Knowledge</p>
<p>I think the main difference is knowledge. On my professional blog, I already have the knowledge I need to write the post. I can pull from my own experience, books I'm reading, techniques I'm trying, documentation I'm writing, as I craft a post. I have ideas brewing in my head all day, and in the back of my mind I'm always thinking of the next story.</p>
<p>On the corporate blog, though, I can't pull from my own experience. I don't know the details of what I should write, because I'm not the subject matter expert. I have to track down the subject matter expert, and then extract the right information from him or her. I have to tease around for the story, I have to locate the substance. Once I do gather the right information from the sources, then it's not so difficult to write the article, because I've absorbed the knowledge.</p>
<p>Controversy</p>
<p>In addition to gathering information from external sources, on the corporate blog, I also have to stay away from controversy. Every story ends happily. You can't go for the jugular, so to speak, and enter controversial territory with an open-mind like you can on an independent blog. Instead, the end is usually written from the beginning.</p>
<p>Voice</p>
<p>Another problem with corporate blogs is the lack of voice. Is there really an "I"? If there is no true "I" behind the posts, how can the blog ever move beyond marketing material and corporate communications? And if there is an "I", do you no longer represent the company or organization that you're writing on behalf of? How do you both represent yourself and your employer?</p>
<p>Regardless of the type of blog, acknowledge your own individual perspective, and don't shun the I. As  long as you focus outward rather than inward, the first person point of  view won't matter. It won't end up being narcissist.</p>
<p>Consistency</p>
<p>If I were to sit down every morning at work and write a new blog post, I would have more content to publish than managers could approve. This happened with my first job as a writer/editor. I wrote so many articles -- spotlights on alumni, since I worked for an alumni house -- that my manager couldn't keep up. It's always been that way.</p>
<p>Why is it, then, that I find the corporate blog post so stifling? Why don't the words just flow? Is it because they aren't my words? The perspective is not my perspective? The points I mak</p>
