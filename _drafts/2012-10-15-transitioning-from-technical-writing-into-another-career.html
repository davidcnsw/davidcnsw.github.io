<div>I am working as a technical writer for quite a long time, and I am considering a change of path from being a technical writer to being something else. One area of interest is sales and marketing. How do I transition from technical writing to marketing?</div>
<div>How do I look for opportunities that will enable me to use my existing skills to get into a marketing/sales job?</div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: medium;">What other fields a technical writer can explore for a </span><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">career</span><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: medium;"> change, apart from marketing/sales?</span></div>
