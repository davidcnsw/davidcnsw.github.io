<p><em><strong>Update</strong>: For a list of available mentors, see this mentor page from <a href="http://mentoring.stc-carolina.org/Find+a+Mentor">STC Carolina</a>. </em></p>
<p>Starting out in technical writing is tough. Putting together a compelling portfolio, deciding whether to pursue a certificate or degree, understanding where to look for jobs and how to sort through the requirements -- it can all be challenging.</p>
<p>Although many people land on I'd Rather Be Writing and seek me out for advice, I don't have the time to provide mentorship and advice to all the people who need it. But there are many tech comm professionals who are interested in providing some guidance to newcomers. They just might not have highly visible blogs that guide newcomers to them.</p>
<p>I would like to help connect technical writing mentors with people who are seeking help. As a mentor, here are the tasks you will likely do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Review a person's resume</li>
<li>Review a person's writing samples</li>
<li>Evaluate questions about a certificate or degree program</li>
<li>Provide location advice for jobs</li>
<li>Answer questions about tools</li>
<li>Explain daily tasks and workflows of the profession</li>
</ul>
<p>To either sign up as a mentor or request a mentor, contact me through the form below:</p>
