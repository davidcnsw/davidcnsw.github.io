<p>Integrating video into your online help material can help you consolidate all your information in one source, as well as present the video to the user in the context of an actual help topic. However, video doesn't embed directly into help for a variety of reasons. Instead, it's more practical to show the video in a pop-up window.</p>
<p>Let's put the technical feasibility of video integration aside for a minute. We know that integrating Captivate videos into RoboHelp, Mimic videos into Flare, or any video into a help authoring tool is possible. In fact, if you use Camtasia Studio, you can embed your video into your help by doing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Produce the video as an Express Show format with the SWF option for the video format, and do not select the Embed in HTML check box. It's critical that you use the Express Show format; otherwise your videos won't have the Flash wrapper that progressively loads the video. Additionally, the Express Show format (without the HTML embed option selected) combines everything into one handy SWF file.</li>
<p>Insert the video into your help authoring tool. With Flare, after inserting the video, right-click and reset the resize the video to the correct dimensions.
</ul>
<p>However, embedding video into a help topic is problematic for one main reason: video dimensions are usually much larger than help file dimensions. Good practices in text readability is to keep the width of your columns between 55 and 75 characters wide. Let's say the average help file's column width is 100 characters wide (about 500 to 600 pixels). If you embed the video into this topic, the video dimensions will either need to fit into the same width as the text column, or the video width will extend far beyond the text column, leaving a large gap on the right. In short, videos are too big to fit in the flow of regular help content.</p>
<p>If you shrink the video, you lose clarity. About the only time this isn't true is if you have HD rendering capability and can preserve the clarity while reducing the dimensions. However, you usually need to upload your videos to Youtube or Vimeo to render the video as HD.</p>
<p>I record all my videos as 1024 x 768 pixels. Some people recommend recording at 800 x 600, but that size is usually so small it requires you to later implement a series of pans and zooms to show the various parts of the application. Most applications will look decent if you record at 1024 x 768px. Most users have resolutions that support this size. Additionally, by sticking with 1024 x 768 pixels, you can take advantage of recording the exact dimensions and place every time. </p>
<p>When I record screencasts, I set one of my monitor's resolutions to 1024 x 768 pixels, and then I capture the full screen. If I need to record another video segment, I don't have to guess where I positioned the capture box. I can just capture the full screen again, and the placement/location of the application will be exact in the video frame. No more guessing, and you can easily make fixes to video recordings. </p>
<p>However, if you embed the 1024 x 768 px video into your online help, you have to add an additional 200 px for the online help's table of contents pane. Now you're really running out of real estate. If your help opens up at 1250 x 800 pixels, it will practically hide the application. This makes it tough for users who are trying to follow along in the help step by step and have the two windows open side by side. (Assume your users don't have dual monitors.)</p>
<p>About the only way to integrate video with your help content is by adding a javascript link that opens the video in a pop-up window that has been resized to the exact dimensions of the video and which strips out the toolbar to save space. With a custom-defined frame size, you don't have to scale down your 1024 x 768 px video, so you maintain the clarity. Additionally, as a pop-up, users won't lose their place in the help as they watch the video. </p>
<p>A few more notes for Flare users. You can add your video files directly to Flare, but I found that doing so leaves the Open Navigation Pane link at the top. It also increases the compile time when you build your targets. It's just easier to upload the video folders into a separate location and call them from there.</p>
