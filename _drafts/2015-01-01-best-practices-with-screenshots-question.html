<p>A reader asks:</p>
<blockquote><p>I searched your site, but couldn't find a best practices for screenshots outside of Flare.</p>
<p>Currently I'm at an organization that uses Snaggit, Word, and Acrobat as the tools, and for some reason the screenshots in the PDF are hideous. I understand the limitations of this tool set, but I have never encountered results as embarrassing as these. I have experimented with the Acrobat settings and with how I paste or inserted the image into Word from Snaggit, but have seen no gain in quality.</p>
<p>How you have any tips or best practices in your archive?</p></blockquote>
<p>If you want images to look crisp in print and load quickly online on an HTML page and PDF, you'll need two screenshots. For the PDF version, use a TIF format and scale down the image in Word by simply dragging it smaller. This will probably result in a huge file size, so experiment to find the right balance. TIF is a lossless format, meaning it shouldn't drop pixels when you make it smaller.</p>
<p>A typical TIF image might be 2-5 MB or more. For online images, you want them to be much smaller, about 50K to 200K. I'm not sure whether you can play with the image settings in Acrobat to resize the images there.</p>
<p>You could capture screenshots with Snagit and save the file as a .snagit file. Then create two files from that: the TIF (for print) and the PNG (for online).</p>
<p>I'm not sure if Word handles a lot of TIF images well. I imagine if you have 100 TIF images each at 5MG, your Word file is going to load slowly and crash.</p>
