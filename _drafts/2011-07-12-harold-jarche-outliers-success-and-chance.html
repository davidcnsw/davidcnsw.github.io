<p>From Harold Jarche reading Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers:</p>
<blockquote><p>It takes a long time to develop deep skill in an area, about 10,000 hours, says Gladwell. The advantage is to those who develop these skills just before they come into great demand, like computer programming before the 1980′s or tailoring prior to an explosion of the garment industry. Like being born at the right moment, timing is everything. via <a href="http://www.jarche.com/2011/07/outliers-success-and-chance/">Harold Jarche » Outliers, success and chance</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>I read Gladwell's Outliers about 2 years ago. The 10,000 hours part is what has stuck with me. I think every post I write on this blog contributes to those 10,000 hours. Maybe one day I'll be skilled enough to actually write a book.</p>
<p>But the key is to anticipate a future trend, and then log those 10,000 hours before the trend breaks into mainstream.</p>
<p>What is the trend on the horizon for tech comm? I think it's screencasts.</p>
