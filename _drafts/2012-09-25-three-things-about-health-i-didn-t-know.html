<p>About a month ago, my mom flew out from Florida for a visit. While she was here, she taught me a couple of health tips that I didn't know.</p>
<h2>Kefir</h2>
<p>My mother brought with her a kefir grain. How she smuggled this through the airport security, I don't know. Basically, a kefir grain is a living organism that cultures milk. I don't know much about it, but basically you put this grain (which resembles a blob that looks like tapioca pudding stuck together) into a jar of milk. You put a paper cloth and rubber band over the jar and put it some place dim for about a day. If you see the jar during the day, shake it a bit.</p>
<p>In the morning, put a plastic fork or spoon into the jar and spoon out the kefir grain into a new jar with new milk. Add the cultured milk into a blender and make a fruit smoothie out of it. The smoothie will be a little tart, but you'll soon grow to enjoy the tart taste. (Apparently people in Russia drink kefir all the time.)</p>
<p>Why would someone do this? Again, I'm no expert, but apparently the kefir grain cultures all kinds of good bacteria. Our body is teeming with bacteria already, and this good bacteria helps fight the bad.</p>
<p>My sister has been drinking kefir nearly a year now and claims neither she nor her kids have been sick since she started. Neither have I, but it's too early to tell, since it's only been a month. Even if it doesn't work, since 40% of placebos have some positive effect, I figure it must at least do something.</p>
<h2>Avoid Gatorade</h2>
<p>Since I'd been riding my bike to work, I started drinking a lot of Gatorade. A bottle during the morning ride, sometimes half a bottle in the afternoon on the ride home, and on days when I played basketball, sometimes some Gatorade there as well. I grew to love the taste of Gatorade -- any flavor/color/shade.</p>
<p>Then something odd started to happen. My eyes started to get itchy. I thought the itchiness was due to allergies, because I have summer allergies like many others, but my eyes would just hurt and itch when I had no other allergy symptoms. I thought I had an eye infection, so I actually dropped a bit of Vigamox in my eyes, but it did nothing. (The Vigamox was leftover from my kids' old prescriptions.) Then I thought it must be related to my contact lenses somehow.</p>
<p>When my mom visited, she explained that one side effect of Gatorade's sucrose-dextrose (fake sugar) is itchy, sensitive eyes. I could hardly believe it. I stopped taking Gatorade, and about two weeks later my itchy eyes cleared up. They haven't returned since I stopped drinking Gatorade. I don't know if it's coincidence, but if sucrose/dextrose can lead to that effect, I certainly want to steer clear of it.</p>
<p>Now I just squeeze a lemon or lime in water and add a teaspoon of sugar. It tastes decent and I'm not clawing my eyes out.</p>
<h2>Two Cups of Water Before Dinner</h2>
<p>My mom didn't teach me this one. The Human Body app did. When your stomach expands to a certain point, it sends a message to your brain that you're full. If the sending of this message has nothing to do with nutrients in your stomach, I figured I could drink two full glasses of water before eating dinner each night and thereby not eat as much. My stomach will send a message to my little old brain that it has had enough to eat -- before I stuff my face with high calorie foods.</p>
<p>So far, this turns out to be a really easy habit, and although I'm not sure if it's doing much, it feels good drinking this water before dinner.</p>
<h2>Other Health Tips</h2>
<p>I'm collecting other little health tips. Since this blog isn't a health and nutrition blog, this post is a tangent to my normal theme. But I'm intrigued by the idea that through little changes and small habits, you can significantly improve your health. Here are a few other tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't eat after 7pm.</li>
<li>Take the stairs.</li>
<li>Stretch before exercising.</li>
<li>Track your calories.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
