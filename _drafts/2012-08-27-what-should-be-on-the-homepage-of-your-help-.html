<p>Recently my colleague leaned over to me and noted that his help's homepage received the highest number of hits from users. This is partly due to the fact that some context-sensitive help links break in certain browsers and revert to the home page (the help is legacy content from an older help authoring tool). But the homepage also receives so many hits because it is the entry portal to help content when users seek information.</p>
<p>The homepage for my help also ranks number one in hits. Given that the homepage is usually the most visited page in help, what should appear on the homepage? This is the equivalent of a billboard in Times Square. What is the most important message you want people to see?</p>
<p>This is a rather difficult decision. Here are a few options:</p>
<h2>Present the most popular questions</h2>
<p>Remember my post a while back on the <a title="80/20 rule" href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2012/04/17/leveraging-the-wisdom-of-the-8020-rule-focusing-on-content-that-matters/">80/20 principle</a>? This principle says that 20% of your content might address 80% of the user's needs. The most popular content falls in line with the 20%. You might extract the top 10 questions that users ask, and add that up front.</p>
<p>Granted, these popular questions should probably exist within the context of the appropriate topic as well, which means they might appear twice in your help. Still, I think given their popularity, repeating the questions shouldn't be such a redundant task. The more places it appears, the more likely users will read it.</p>
<h2>Provide a variety of help resources</h2>
<p>The homepage might also provide a variety of help resources, such as quick reference guides, how-to guides, video tutorials, and other help collateral. When a user clicks the help button, they can choose to view the type of help that fits their situation. The help they want may not be a comprehensive online help file, but rather a video tutorial, or a quick reference guide, or a printed how-to guide. The homepage acts as a routing board for the place the user wants to go. The homepage isn't the destination. Rather, it's a transition page.</p>
<p>Let's look at some items that appear on home pages of popular help applications.</p>
