<p>I am working as a technical writer for quite a long time, and I am considering a change of path from being a technical writer to being something else. One area of interest is sales and marketing. How do I transition from technical writing to marketing?<br />
How do I look for opportunities that will enable me to use my existing skills to get into a marketing/sales job?</p>
<p>What other fields a technical writer can explore for a career change, apart from marketing/sales?</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
