<h2>Organizing Information That Keeps Growing</h2>
<p>Switching back and forth between the agora and the desert led me to another realization. The more information we add, the more difficult it becomes to manage. How much information is too much? How long before answers get buried in other answers, which are then buried in other answers? How long before instructions are hidden and overshadowed by the endless notes, workarounds, fixes, responses, and other additions we've included?</p>
<p>Earlier in this series, I wrote about <a title="the information paradox" href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2011/01/12/findability-and-the-information-paradox/">the information paradox</a>, explaining</p>
<blockquote><p>The more information you add to a help file, the more informative it becomes because it contains more information. However, as you add more information to your help file, it also becomes less informative because it's harder for users to find that information.</p></blockquote>
<p>In interviewing Mark Baker, who summarized Weinberger, he says to <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2012/12/11/podcast-include-it-all-filter-it-afterwards-interview-with-mark-baker/">include it all and let the user filter it afterwards</a>, usually through a search tool. This strategy builds on the idea of the <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2012/06/11/essay-my-journey-to-and-from-wikis-why-i-adopted-wikis-why-i-veered-away-from-them-and-a-new-model-for-collaboration/">Long Tail</a>. Users want to answers to all their questions, even the odd, non-mainstream, edge case questions, and they want to find it in one place. This is why sites like Amazon do so well — they succeed at the Long Tail, earning more profit from sales of non-mainstream products than mainstream products.</p>
<p>How do you expand your content infinitely in an organized, logical way? Where do you stuff in all the extra information? How do you convince project managers that, even though you've released and the documentation is "complete," you're not done, and that the help keeps growing and growing?</p>
<p>As soon as you embrace into the idea that you should include it all, filter it afterward, you set yourself up for a huge amount of content to organize. What if you start out with about 20,000 words in your help system, but over the course of a month, you triple that amount of content. How do you organize it all? Search becomes the only sensible way to find content. Everything becomes like Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Earlier in this series I explored the idea of <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2010/05/21/implementing-faceted-classificationsearch-with-a-help-authoring-tool-organizing-content-7/">metadata as an organizing tool</a>. In one of Weinberger's previous books, <em><a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2011/04/15/everything-is-miscellaneous-by-david-weinberger/">Everything Is Miscellaneous</a></em>, he argues that we should add metadata to our information objects and let the reader pull the metadata he or she wants.</p>
<p>This sounds logical and insightful, but it's hard to figure out just how to implement it in a help system (see my <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2010/05/21/implementing-faceted-classificationsearch-with-a-help-authoring-tool-organizing-content-7/">previous post on faceted classification</a> for more details). What metadata? Besides topics, there isn't a whole lot. Role, product, format, location, department, topic type, and so on might work, but only some metadata is relevant. In the end, the metadata approach may be much better for physical things with attributes, such as shoes, than with help information.</p>
<p><a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2012/12/11/podcast-include-it-all-filter-it-afterwards-interview-with-mark-baker/">Mark says</a> the solution to length is structure, but he's not necessarily referring to DITA and its task, concept, and reference topic types. (See <a href="http://everypageispageone.com/2012/08/20/everything-else-is-not-a-concept/">Everything Else Is Not a Concept</a> and the <a href="http://everypageispageone.com/2012/07/28/the-tyranny-of-the-terrible-troika-rethinking-concept-task-and-reference/">Tyranny of the Terrible Troika</a>). Instead he refers to common patterns we follow (almost unconsciously) for different types of information, such as recipes.</p>
<p>I'll address structure and patterns in an upcoming post.</p>
<p>Does information mapping, a competing theory about structure, provide a better model? According to <a href="http://informationmapping.com/us/resources/blog/entry/the-dita-topic-types-square-pegs-and-round-holes">Information Mapping</a>, there are six basic types of information:</p>
<blockquote><p>Process—What Happens, Who Does What</p>
<p>Procedure—“How Tos,” Step-by-Step Work Instructions</p>
<p>Principle—Policies, Rules, Guidelines</p>
<p>Concept—Ideas, Definitions, Abstractions</p>
<p>Structure—Parts, Functions, Components</p>
<p>Fact—Statements, Specifications</p></blockquote>
<p>These look useful as a way to classify different types of information, but information <em>types</em> aren't necessarily <em>structure</em>. Some help topics mix all of these types of information. You start out with a concept and include a principle, move on to a procedure (or process), and end with ... something else.</p>
<p>To be honest, I'm not that clear about information mapping because the information is trademarked and put behind a pay wall. But I like the idea of thinking about structure. I think we need to identify a series of common structures in tech comm to more easily plug in the massive amount of information. Not necessarily a structure to enable single sourcing, but to help organize content. Surely task, concept, and reference are several topic types. But some other standard topics and patterns need to be fleshed out into helpful structures.</p>
<p>What structures do you use to help organize and assemble your help content?</p>
