<p>I had high hopes of finishing the Old Testament this year with my family, but I got stuck in Psalms and have been sluggish ever since entering the section of books known as the writings and wisdom literature. To finish, I have another 400 pages to go before the end of December.</p>
<p>As I calculated out the pages per day I'd have to read, it turns out reading 15 pages a day would allow me to easily reach my goal. Hmmm, I thought. Just 15 pages a day isn't much. In fact, when you break down goals into a little-by-little approach, they're much more achievable.</p>
<p>I also have a goal to master Adobe Illustrator. To achieve this goal, I plan to watch three Illustrator tutorials from Lynda.com each day. I also have some goals with non-fiction books, with plans to read 25 pages a day. I find that when I do this little amount, it sets me flying through the book. Often times these small goals just help get the momentum going; sometimes I'll read a lot more, especially when I can't sleep.</p>
<p>I don't know if I'm on to something, but little-by-little goals seem to be a practical, easy approach to achieving goals.</p>
<p>On the other hand, plodding away at small goals doesn't work so well for me. Sure, 15 pages a day may amount to great progress, but it doesn't allow me to get in the zone and stay there. When you immerse yourself in a task -- for an entire afternoon -- you start gaining momentum and move through the content with more understanding, energy, and ideas. Rather than chopping your day into little pieces, let it flow continuously like a full-bodied river .</p>
<p>At work I'm often faced with this same dilemma. At any one time, I have a ton of tasks to do. If I set myself toward doing all of them at once, I go in scattered, fragmented directions. Update this wiki page, call a SME to find out new information, create a layout in InDesign, create a graphic in Illustrator, create translated pages for this content, and so on -- across five different projects. Taking one step forward, one step to the side, one step back, and so on, approaching everything in 15 minute increments, is a recipe for insanity.</p>
<p>Instead, I choose one thing to focus on for the day, and ignore the rest of my work. It's not possible to do it all. I focus on that task and immerse myself in it. For example, today I dedicated most of my time toward adjusting the Mediawiki skin I created for my help platform. It's not a 15-minute type of task. Really. I toyed with this platform for hours, sometimes in deep concentration.</p>
<p>Last Sunday I couldn't sleep, and I started reading the Old Testament again. I made my way through 35 Psalms, all of Proverbs, and all of Ecclesiastes. I feel like I understand it much more when I immerse myself in it, rather than take it bit by bit. Reason being, I can keep a better grasp of the whole, I can see the larger picture, I don't forget names or places, and I better understand how the themes play into the entire narrative.</p>
