<p>After my MindTouch webinar on findability, one of the attendees followed up to ask my why I didn't talk about indexes. Indexes are a key tool to allow users to find content they're looking for.</p>
<p>I didn't omit indexes on purpose, and surely they're one of the cornerstone methods end-users resort to when trying to find content. A good index is highly valuable.</p>
<p>A lot of people think that search has done away with the need for an index. While that may be partly true, I use indexes all the time. Not too long ago, a user was praising me for the index I had included in an help file.</p>
<p>It turns out that indexers, that nerdy librarian-like group of word gurus, has somewhat evolved. I've been reading The Accidental Taxonomist, by Heather Hedden. Heather explains that the word "taxonomy" is now the mainstream word used to encompass indexing, metadata, information architecture, search retrieval, tagging, user interface terms, and more.</p>
<p>There's a whole world here I haven't explored.</p>
