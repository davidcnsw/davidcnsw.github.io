<p>About 6 months ago, I abandoned wikis as a platform because I didn't feel collaboration resulted in the payoff it promised. If I'm going to be the main one authoring the content, I decided to choose a tech comm tool that suits me well, one that would be powerful and robust to do whatever I wanted. I didn't need to compromise on a platform that could be simple enough for the masses. No, I could pick pretty much anything I wanted because I would be the one doing the authoring. I chose Flare and was pretty happy with it.</p>
<p>Well, one day after moving all my documentation to Flare, I started to feel uneasy about the inconsistent branding in the output. I work for a large organization, where technical writers exist in tribal pockets and use their own tools based on their specific situations and autonomous wills. I started documenting a Member Portal site that pulled in modules from about a dozen different applications, many with different ways of delivering and branding help.</p>
<p>I thought about this inconsistency for a while and set myself to begin customizing Flare's HTML5 output to look exactly like my organization's website. After spending several hours, I realized that the way Flare's output was designed wasn't very flexible. Although I could change some elements to the HTML5 output, such as adding a background image and logo, and changing typography and colors, I couldn't make any major modifications to the layout or design.</p>
<p>I'm not a newbie to web design. I've been doing Wordpress consulting for the past three years, so I'm used to making websites for people, especially making themes that look like existing websites. The way Flare works, it dynamically generates the output and allows you to customize some elements of the output, but not to really gut and renovate. If you want to gut and renovate the theme, you'll have to make the changes each time you generate a new version of the help, which isn't practical.</p>
<p>I also noticed that Flare stripped out media queries from the mobile output. I could add them back in after the compile, but it was annoying. And fixes, enhancements, and improvements seemed slow in coming.</p>
<p>I started to realize that if i wanted a web friendly output, I needed to use a web friendly tool. But what about all of those features in Flare that I loved so much? What would happen if I switched over to a web-based tool? I'd pretty much have to say goodbye to print format, cross references, export for translation, image single sourcing, conditions, indexes, and more.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if I wanted a platform that was truly of the web, that was in step with the latest web trends, conventions, and best practices, from responsive design to jQuery effects, comments, search engine optimization, and completely custom branding, I would need to use a web-based tool like WordPress.</p>
<p>So here's what I did: I use Flare as my authoring source, but rather than staying in Flare with the output, I now import Flare's HTML output into Wordpress. WordPress is the web-based container for the HTML content.</p>
<p>Why WordPress? WordPress not only maintains pace with the web, it practically is the web (like <a href="http://www.wptavern.com/the-last-10-things-you-need-to-know-about-wordpress">22% of it anyway</a>). If you want a tool that does everything you want (there are 20,000+ plugins), with little technical expertise, then you want WordPress.</p>
<p>Let's move past the abstract to a much more nitty gritty how-to of the process. Here are the steps for my workflow:</p>
