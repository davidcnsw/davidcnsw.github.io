<p>An impression occurs when someone loads a page where your ad is visible. Different ad spaces are more visible than others. You can select from among 3 different ad spaces. Impressions are tracked through Google Analytics.</p>
<h3>Sidebar ad space</h3>
<p>Sidebar ads appear in the right sidebar and randomly rotate positions each time the page refreshes -- this helps refocus the reader's attention on the ads. There is no specific hierarchy to ads in the sidebar.</p>
<p>Your ad can be any image type (JPG, GIF, or PNG) and color, but the dimensions must be exactly 125 x 125 pixels in size. Slow-looping animated GIFs are allowed, but not Flash. You can switch the ad at any time by sending me a new graphic.</p>
<p><img style="border:1px solid #dedede;" title="Sidebar ads" src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/ads_sidebar.png" alt="sidebar ads" width="340" height="420" /> Sidebar ads appear on the right sidebar in a single column. They rotate randomly with each page refresh.</p>
<h3>Horizontal Inline Ad Space</h3>
<p>The Horizontal Inline space (550px x 70px) appears below each post, right above the comments, in the single post view. This highly visible space is inline with the reader's eye and provides a natural click-point after a reader finishes reading a post.</p>

<p>Horizontal Inline ads here can also be animated GIF if desired. The positions also rotate randomly with each page refresh.</p>
<h3>Top Banner Ad Space</h3>
<p>The top banner ad space(470px x 60px) refers to the top section of the site, in the upper-right corner.</p>
<p><figure><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/top_banner-600x292.png" alt="Top Banner Ad Space" width="600" height="292" /> <figcaption>The Top Banner ad space, which appears at the top of the site, catches the eye of most readers.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The top banner ad is placed in one of the most visually dominant places on the site.</p>
<p>There is only one ad in the Top Banner ad space, but it can rotate depending on the number of ads in this space. If the top banner ad rotates, the price is lowered proportionally. For example, if two ads display here, alternating with each page refresh, the cost is split in half. For three ads, the cost is split into thirds.</p>
<h3>Number of impressions per year</h3>
<p>From Jan 1, 2014 to Dec 31, 2014, Idratherbewriting.com had about 588,000 page views. Here's a chart from Google Analytics.</p>

<h3>Quality of impressions</h3>
<p>The quality of impressions depends on the influence of the site. Impressions from a highly influential site carry more weight than impressions from a less influential site.</p>
<p>MindTouch named me one of the most influential bloggers in technical communication. Influence is based on how many other top #techcomm insiders follow me on Twitter.</p>

<h3>Impression rates (CPM)</h3>
<p>Impressions are usually calculated by CPM (cost per mille, or cost per 1,000 impressions). However, presently I'm just tracking impressions by page views on the site, since each ad always appears with each page load.</p>
<p>The cost for each ad space is as follows:</p>
<table>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Ad space</strong></td>
        <td><strong>Cost per year</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Sidebar graphic (125px x 125px)</td>
        <td>$900/year</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Horizontal inline post view (550px x 70px)</td>
        <td>$1,800/year</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Top Banner space (470px x 60px)</td>
        <td>$6,000/year for single ad display, $3,000/year if rotated between 2 ads, or $2,000/year if rotated between 3 ads.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>(By the way, assuming 588,000 page views per year, the CPM rate for the sidebar graphic comes out to $1.53 CPM, for the horizontal inline view $3.06 CPM, and for the top banner ad space, $8.50 CPM. These costs align with the <a href="http://monetizepros.com/blog/2014/average-cpm-rates/">average CPM rates for 2014</a>.)</p>
