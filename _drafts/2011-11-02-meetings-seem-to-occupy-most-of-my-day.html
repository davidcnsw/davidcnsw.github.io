<p>I'm not sure how it happened, but it seems these past two weeks have marked a shift in my level of busyness at work. I have many more meetings, and things going on between the meetings. As a result, I don't get much done. Only when 4 pm rolls around and things quiet down do I manage to actually find time.</p>
<p>It's not that the meetings are unnecessary, but holy smokes, just a few meetings in one day kills all my momentum. My most productive times are when I can remove myself and sequester myself away in some isolated room to work. The problem is, that makes interaction difficult. Often I need to contact numerous people, get information from them, get them to review things. It drives me nuts when people aren't available. I don't want to be one of those people who never answers his phone or returns email. At the same time, doing this seems to drain away my time.</p>
