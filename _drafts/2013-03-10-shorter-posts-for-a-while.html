<p>For the past couple of years my posts have gotten pretty long, averaging about 1,000 to 2,000 words each. But now that I'm starting a new job, I'm focusing more attention on ramping up some of my technical skills, so my posts are going to be shorter, such as 200 to 500 word posts. I don't know why I'm even announcing this in a post, but I felt I should say something if my writing style differs for a while. </p>
<p>I usually like lengthy posts because they mean the writer is digging deep in a topic, but the short post format can still provide nuggets of insight, expressed in a condensed way, perhaps prompting more questions than answers.</p>
