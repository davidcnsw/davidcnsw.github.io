<p><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-13948" alt="Competing models of help" src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/storemodel-125x125.png" width="125" height="125" />One of the recurring themes I keep returning to is the relationship between tech comm and the web. In Mark Baker's most recent post, he notes,</p>
<p>Tech comm did not abandon readers to the Web. Readers abandoned tech comm for the Web.</p>
<p>His post argues for including an abundance of content, similar to the web, and allowing users to filter the content using tools such as search engines. He says readers aren't overwhelmed by the information overload of the web, and therefore seek other, more minimalist sources of information. Instead, readers crave this abundance of information and use their tools (from search to social media tools) to filter it.</p>
<p>I completely agree with Mark and like the logic of his argument. In this post, I want to veer into a little different direction in comparing tech comm with the web. I was recently reading about all the new social media features available in Flare 9. I haven't tried the new Pulse integration, but it looks fabulous. I'm really glad to see so much forward motion towards social tools with documentation. With Pulse, Flare is getting more and more like the web, that is, social and interactive.</p>
<p>However, I'm coming to see documentation in a new light. Help authoring tools are great when you want to isolate your help content from your other web content, and allow users to search just within a specific domain of knowledge. There are many use cases for this, and certainly companies like Salesforce, which publish, for some of their documentation, individual help files so that user aren't forced to wade through mountains of content, there's a real logic in the approach.</p>
<p>But there's also a logic for putting all your content on the same platform. Help authoring tools that have their own authoring and publishing mechanisms by their very nature silo themselves off from other groups, such as support and marketing. Support often has its own publishing tool, and marketing has another. Sales might have yet another (hopefully not). When every group has its own tool for writing, managing, and publishing content, you end up with a bunch of silos that fragment the content and confuse the user experience.</p>
<p>What if each of these different groups -- tech comm, support, marketing, sales, and others -- all published content using the same platform? How might that look? Would a help authoring tool work for that? No, because non-tech comm groups will be wary of adopting a robust help authoring tool with a learning curve. Will Support adopt a HAT instead of their own tool for publishing knowledge base articles? Not likely. Will Marketing embrace a HAT to publish content? No. About the only group that will ever use a HAT to publish and maintain their content is tech comm.</p>
<p>As such, help tends to be a link off of the main company website. It doesn't share the same authentication, branding, search engine visibility, and integration as the other company content. When you have several different platforms mashed together under the same umbrella, it just looks stupid. Users bounce from one platform to another, without realizing the search doesn't integrate all the content, or without understanding why things are consistent.</p>
<p>I've had discussions with people who say structured authoring in XML is the only way to bring these groups together. If everyone publishes content in XML, they can upload it to a component content management system and push it out to the channels that they need to. This might work, but you will need a way to enforce the XML structure, and then you'll have a massive content management system to wrestle.</p>
<p>Probably the simplest solution is to use a web platform that all teams can access and authoring content on. For example, a popular web platform such as Drupal, WordPress, Joomla, Alfresco, or some other popular web platform. All the content lives in the same web space. There aren't big walls separate knowledge base articles from help articles from marketing content. All content lives under the same roof, and appears in the same search engines, looks like it all belongs to the same family, and has the characteristics of the web.</p>
<p>As much as tech comm tries to look like the web, until it's actually on the web, it's always going to be siloed off from the rest of the crowd, like a guy at a party who just can't seem to fit in comfortably into any circle.</p>
