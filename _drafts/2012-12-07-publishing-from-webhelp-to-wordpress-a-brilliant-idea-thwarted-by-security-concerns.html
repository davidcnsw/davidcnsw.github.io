<p>This week I was obsessed by what I thought might be a brilliant idea, but which turned out to be thwarted by security concerns. I was trying to skin an HTML5 output from Flare, attempting to make it look exactly like my organization's website. I realized that the difficulty was due to the way Flare integrates content with design at the output.</p>
<p>Most help authoring tools work like this. You can customize the webhelp skin a bit before compiling the output, or generating the target, or whatever you call it -- that magical, mysterious set of processes that kick off when you click Build. After a million processes finish, voila, you have your HTML file and website.</p>
<p>It's kind of cool that these help authoring tools build a website with one click, but have you ever tried to really gut and renovate the webhelp so that it looks like a popular website you might find on the web? You can't. At least, you can't extensively customize it in a way that won't be overwritten with the next build.</p>
<p>Rather than using Flare's output, what I'd like to do is insert the content I've created into an existing web design. So I took the HTML files in the Content folder of Flare's output and disregarded the rest. I put these HTML files into a Webhelp to WordPress Importer and imported them into WordPress. They imported into WordPress as pages.</p>
<p>That's not so exciting, but here's what is. You can keep writing in your help authoring tool and then just continue to import the output back into WordPress. The newly imported pages will not be added as new pages if the page name already exists. If the page name already exists, the new content gets added as a new version to the existing page.</p>
<p>If you import a DITA map file along with the HTML files, the DITA map will imprint a parent/child hierarchy on the files, but I feel this is outdated. WordPress has a better way of managing page hierarchies through the page menu.</p>
<p>Here's a demo of the workflow of webhelp to WordPress.</p>
<p>Why WordPress? Because it's basically the popular content management system for the web, with every plugin imaginable (22,000+), every theme imaginable (many of them responsive). You could immediately take advantage of threaded comments, post rating plugins, most popular topics, related topics, tags, categories, completely custom theming, jQuery effects, search engine optimization, and much more. All of those cool ideas you wish you could implement with your help but never could because your HAT didn't do it? Well, you can with WordPress.</p>
<p>But here's the problem. WordPress works great in the mainstream web space, but take it to the corporate environment and it buckles. Security-wise, WordPress doesn't perform well, apparently. If you use a security tool to probe the vulnerabilities, I'm told that you'll find many, simply because WordPress pulls content out of its database dynamically at run time, which will always generate red flags.</p>
<p>I tried for two days to install WordPress on an internal server and was unsuccessful, even though I've installed it 100+ times on regular web servers.</p>
<p>Oh well. I might try Habari, a forked version of WordPress, instead. Or pray for a miracle.</p>
<p>If you're interested in experimenting with a WordPress output, I'd love to hear from you. You can get the file from <a href="http://zed1.com/journalized/wordpress-plugins/dita-to-wordpress-import-tool/">Mike Little</a>'s site. He called it DITA to WordPress Importer, but a better name would be Webhelp to WordPress, because the importer doesn't import DITA files at all. It just imports the HTML output from DITA, which is the same HTML output as you might expect from Flare, Robohelp, Author-it, and other tools.</p>
<p>To get the importer to work, first, recognize that it's not a plugin.</p>
<p>Upload the ditahelp.php file to the wp-admin folder.</p>
<p>From that same folder, download admin.php</p>
<p>In the admin.php folder, below this line: require_once(ABSPATH . ‘wp-admin/includes/admin.php');<br />
add this:</p>
<p>require_once(‘ditahelp.php');</p>
<p>You will now see a Dita help import option in Tools in the WordPress dashboard.</p>
<p>The DITA Help will import all links as relative links. If you want to have some links import as relative and others import as absolute, then make the changes below. The below code uses an if statement to ask if the link has a style called MCXref xref, which is the link style for cross references in Flare. If it does, then it processes the relative linking paths. If not, it leaves them alone.</p>
<p>As for images, you'll probably have to upload your images separately to a folder path at yoursite/files/resources/images. I didn't modify the image path in the program.</p>
<p>As far as skinning the output, I could provide about a dozen tutorials on that, but not in this post. You can easily farm that work out, by the way.</p>
