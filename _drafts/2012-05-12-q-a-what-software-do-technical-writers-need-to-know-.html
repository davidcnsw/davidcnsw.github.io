<p>A reader asks,</p>
<blockquote><p>How do outsiders learn the software that TechComm folks use? I've looked at Adobe's TechComm suite, MadCap Flare and so on, and the costs are enormous.Â Also, is there some standardized training program for learning all of these, or is it typically on-the-job training? I can't imagine people are expected to purchase these software packages on their own and simply learn at home.</p></blockquote>
<p>This must be one of the most common questions asked by students. You can purchase academic versions of most software at significantly discounted rates. Check with your institution to see if discounted software is already available. I know this is true of Adobe products.</p>
<p>You can also download trial versions of products most of software and learn them for 30 days before they expire.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could learn open source alternatives that never expire.</p>
<p>I wouldn't recommend investing a lot of money into software that you may or may not use at your job. Reason being, the software that technical writers use varies from company to company. If you spend a lot of money learning one tool, the company you get hired by may use an entirely different tool.</p>
