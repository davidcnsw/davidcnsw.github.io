<p>I've been reading Karen McGrane's book on Mobile Content Strategy. It turns out, it's not really about mobile. It's about making your content free so that it can live anywhere, on desktops, mobile devices, and other channels. Karen writes,</p>
<p>Responsive design is often hel up as a solution that saves you from having to maintain multiple separate codebases for your fron-tend code. put the effort ino to developinoe on set of code that will adapt to different screen sizes and progressively enhance for different device capabilities,a nd you'll save time in the long run. You'll also get out of the arms race of having to support dozens of different devices and form factors. 38</p>
<p>The future is adaptive content. Adaptive content is content that is flexible, so it can adapt to different screen sizes, and can be presented in different formats as appropraie for that device. What's the secret to this flexibility? Why, it's having more structure! Adaptive content has structure and metadata attached to it, which helps it figure out what to do when it winds up on all those different platforms and devices. 46</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adaptive content is more than just "mobile." It means getting your content into a format so you can share and distribute it to any platform you want. It means you can get your content onto platforms you control--and platforms you don't. It even means you'll have a fighting shot at getting your content onto platforms that haven't been invented yet..47</p>

<p>http://www.wvanweelden.eu/product/blue-ocean this is an example where there are three separate designs for different devices. how do you hook that up to your help? some kind of complicated if then device call? i'm not sure that works.</p>
