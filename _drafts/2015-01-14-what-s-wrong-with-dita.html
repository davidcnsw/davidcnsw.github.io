<p>What's wrong with DITA</p>
<ul>
<li>enforced information typing is too constraining. information patterns, sure, but i think the types </li>
<li>core DITA, without the specialized types, is much better, but ....</li>
<li>in order to incorporate any modern web features (e.g., see twitter bootstrap -- tabs, collapsible sections, scroll spy, accordions, and more), you have to do ninja backflips with the code</li>
<li>DITA doesn't give you more robust web publishing options. relies too heavily on transform scripts that are too complicated, so you end up buying into a vendor. </li>
<li>oxygen's webhelp output is all right, but loads really slowly, is buggy (sometimes content doesn't show unless you toggle a divider), requires you to rebuild the whole thing each time, and still looks pretty old school. syntax highlighting is poor. not very flexible if you want a modern web platform.</li>
<li>working in DITA code editor is way too cumbersome. all those tags get in the way of reading code. if you switch to a visual view, the rich text editor ends up screwing over the code. markdown is much better.</li>
<li>DITA's conditional filtering is cool, but there aren't any implementations where it works. you end up with a ton of different outputs, and all those diff. outputs is terrible for your SEO. you end up delivering 20 different outputs to the user, when what you really need is one smart one.</li>
<li>so easy to outgrow DITA. it's fun to learn and use, but the whole logic of the schema is baffling</li>
<li>DITA community is too small, even among tech pubs. tech comm needs to plug into the world wide web for its architecture. </li>
<li>DITA develops too slowly. i'm not knocking the fact that the spec is slow to evolve, with one update every 5 years. new DITA tools come on scene all the time, but how many of those are open source? how many of those are sold by proprietary vendors charging thousands of dollars, requiring extensive migrations, etc. the narrative DITA consultants keep selling is that you have to make the case for ROI. but what kind of ROI does DITA really have when it takes 2 years to go live, countless hours of training, extensive developer resources to set up anything custom, etc.? i think that's a load of bull. by the time you implement DITA you look around on the web and realize that you're a dinosaur.</li>
<li>DITA is not any easier than straight HTML. you'd be better off just coding your site in raw HTML, I think.</li>
</ul>
