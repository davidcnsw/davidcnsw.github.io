<p>the first or earliest form of writing was with scrolls that you roll up and put into a basket.</p>
<p>then came the codex.</p>
<p>now comes the electronic version.</p>
<p>you have an author who maybe doesn't have a specific chronology. put into a book, the material follows a chronology.</p>
<p>now you have more versatility to move from one book to another. is chronology the dominant metaphor? now you have tagging and collections.</p>
<p>soon you'll be able to share collections, so that you have a collective reading.</p>
<p>how does this relate to findability? the device users use to navigate the material determines the metaphor they impose. prob. more prevalent with books. But now my notes, rather than being grouped with the books, they're intermixed with other notes. they're aggregated by tag. study becomes more topical and thematic, because now you're organizing by theme.</p>
<p>first you organized by who knows what. then it was into a book, so you invoked chronology and sequence. now it's by tag and collection.</p>
<p>what about a kindle? how does that change the reading experience? the hyperlink? was the hyperlink revolutionary in the way it changed reading?</p>
<p>with web formats, every hyperlink poses a challenge to the reader. it forces the reader to decide whether to jump to a new starting point. it's as if a new chapter starts there, at every link. so the hyperlink changed reading modes.</p>
<p>how about the mobile device. how does a mobile device change consumption? you're no longer reading in long periods, but in bits and chunks.</p>
<p>what other devices might you read with? some devices, the book, forces a more linear sequence of reading. we know this with the way people read online help versus the way they read a printed guide. one is linear, the other non-linear.</p>
<p>some devices force a non-linear reading experience. that's what we're moving towards with digital media, because you can chop up the material and twist the way you look at it, by author, date, category, tag, time period, and then you can reorder all the material from that view.</p>
<p>the mode of travel determines your experience of an area, whether you see it by plane, train, automobile, or on foot. in the same vein, the vehicle by which you explore a text has some bearing on how you interpret that text. the different vehicles for exploring text are: in a book, as a list of excerpts, in a web format, on a mobile device.</p>
<p>in order to see new perspectives on a text, you have to use a different vehicle to explore it. what vehicle could you use to explore a text? there are of course different lenses that you could use to explore the text.</p>
<p>different languages to explore the same text.</p>
<p>different historical situations to explore the text.</p>
<p>different personal histories and struggles.</p>
<p>different ethnic backgrounds.</p>
<p>we all know this, but what about technology. how can tech influence what you see in a text?</p>
<p>the most controversial thing i posted on my blog was how inline links hurt readability. but what if you could harness web links for good? at a point of confusion, it offers an expansion of clarity?</p>
<p>the hyperlinked web creates a reading experience that is non-linear, which takes you from one point to another, and you may end up in a place very different from where you started, because everything is linked.</p>
<p>could a six degrees of separation idea work online as well? every topic moves to another topic with just a few levels.</p>
<p>what's another format besides a book?</p>
<p>what's another digital format besides an online representation of a book? we do carry over many of these same features of a book into the digital world. we're very entrenched in this metaphor.</p>
<p>a format besides a book -- a song. you could chant the text. very weird and interesting at the same time. some things were meant to be read as music but are read as text -- namely, the psalms. i very much doubt that all the proverbs were meant to be stacked together like that. i doubt the person who authored kings also was aware of someone authoring chronicles.</p>
<p>you could make your way through a text in different ways. i think the traditional way is to start at the front and work your way to the back. but many of the prophecies weren't meant to be read in a chronlogical fashion. they happened on different days, on different occasions. not always in time-based order. we're so driven toward chronlogy because that's usually how story unfolds. one event happens and then another, and another. i'd like to see a movement away from chornology, because that's probably where so much of the confusion comes into play. you have a tex that spans 2,500 years. chronological, as if it all happened ina  few years? no way.</p>
<p>we already have this nick carr guy asserting that google is making us dumb because of the way it changes how we read. that's an interesting thing to say. the very abundance of information compels us to skim and skip, to read cursorily, to not read deeply, because at one moment of boredom, you know you're just a click away from something else.  this is a major way that the medium is affecting the way people read and experience the text.</p>
<p>From Steven Johnson</p>
<p>I knew then that the book's migration to the digital realm would not be a simple matter of trading ink for pixels, but would likely change the way we read, write and sell books in profound ways. It will make it easier for us to buy books, but at the same time make it easier to stop reading them. It will expand the universe of books at our fingertips, and transform the solitary act of reading into something far more social. It will give writers and publishers the chance to sell more obscure books, but it may well end up undermining some of the core attributes that we have associated with book reading for more than 500 years.</p>
<p>For starters, think about what happened because of the printing press: The ability to duplicate, and make permanent, ideas that were contained in books created a surge in innovation that the world had never seen before. Now, the ability to digitally search millions of books instantly will make finding all that information easier yet again. Expect ideas to proliferate -- and innovation to bloom -- just as it did in the centuries after Gutenberg.</p>
<p>Think about it. Before too long, you'll be able to create a kind of shadow version of your entire library, including every book you've ever read -- as a child, as a teenager, as a college student, as an adult. Every word in that library will be searchable. It is hard to overstate the impact that this kind of shift will have on scholarship. Entirely new forms of discovery will be possible. Imagine a software tool that scans through the bibliographies of the 20 books you've read on a specific topic, and comes up with the most-cited work in those bibliographies that you haven't encountered yet.</p>
<p>Because they have been largely walled off from the world of hypertext, print books have remained a kind of game preserve for the endangered species of linear, deep-focus reading. Online, you can click happily from blog post to email thread to online New Yorker article -- sampling, commenting and forwarding as you go. But when you sit down with an old-fashioned book in your hand, the medium works naturally against such distractions; it compels you to follow the thread, to stay engaged with a single narrative or argument.</p>
<p>As a result, I fear that one of the great joys of book reading -- the total immersion in another world, or in the world of the author's ideas -- will be compromised. We all may read books the way we increasingly read magazines and newspapers: a little bit here, a little bit there.</p>
<p>Think of it as a permanent, global book club. As you read, you will know that at any given moment, a conversation is available about the paragraph or even <em>sentence</em> you are reading. Nobody will read alone anymore. Reading books will go from being a fundamentally private activity -- a direct exchange between author and reader -- to a community event, with every isolated paragraph the launching pad for a conversation with strangers around the world.</p>
<p>Imagine every page of every book individually competing with every page of every other book that has ever been written, each of them commented on and indexed and ranked. The unity of the book will disperse into a multitude of pages and paragraphs vying for Google's attention.</p>
<p>This fragmentation sounds unnerving -- yet another blow to the deep-focus linearity of the print-book tradition. Breaking the book into detachable parts may sell more books, but there are certain kinds of experiences and arguments that can only be conveyed by the steady, directed immersion that a 400-page book gives you. A playlist of the best chapters from "Middlemarch," "Gravity's Rainbow" and "Beloved" will never work the way a playlist of songs culled from different albums does today.</p>

<p>Think about the way Safari does their books. you're not just reading a chapter of a book -- you're reading all the library that has something to say about that same topic. you break up the book paradigm and arrange by topic from a vast array of sources.</p>
<p>-----------------------------------</p>
<p>Last year I set myself to reading the Old Testament (a goal I completed on New Years Eve) and realized something unexpected about formats. Putting aside thematic content, the chronology in the Old Testament is frustrating. One would think that, given the sequential ordering of the books, that the books would follow a chronology, but chronology is a fiction imposed on the text. The Old Testament as a sequential ordering of books is a device that is imposed later than added by the authors themselves. We all know the earliest texts were scrolls that you had to unravel. Scribes kept them in baskets. According to Dr. Martin X, whose lectures are available in Yale's iTunes University offerings, at some point, one of the scribes converted from a scroll to a book format to make it easier to look up and compare different scrolls. This compilation into a book-like format was referred to as a codex -- with the pages sewn together rather than rolled as scrolls.</p>
<p>The transition from scroll to codex brought the idea of a scriptural canon to the forefront. Whereas with scrolls you could simply toss a scroll from one basket to another, the codex required more thought about what scripture was included and excluded from the codex.</p>
<p>Beyond a canon, the format of the codex also presents another unexpected experience: chronology. The books suddenly have an order that is deceptive. I grew frustrated when I realized that Chronicles covers the same ground as Kings, and that Isaiah is a contemporary of Hezekiah, but his writings appear later, as do the writings of other prophets. Order doesn't imply chronology. Sometimes I think the books would be better as a set of independent scrolls in a basket.</p>
<p>I'm just using the Hebrew Bible as an example of a larger principle, which is that the format of a text predisoses readers toward a specific experience of that text. It's kind of like traveling. When you travel through Egypt on a cruise ship down the Nile, it's much different than flying in plane overhead, or than riding down the banks on back of a donkey. Walk, run, ride, crawl -- your experience will different depending on your means of travel, even though you cross the same land. Equally, your experience of a text depends on your vehicle of travel through that text.</p>
<p>Take the same biblical texts and put them online, similar to putting content from a printed guide into the format of an online help, and the reader's experience is transformed by the new format. We technical writers know that with online mediums, readers skim and scan, they search and click, they look for a specific answer. My organization recently launched a new website that presents readers with this same shift. Rather than reading scriptures in their traditional books, they can now use a Study Notebook, where they can highlight passages, make journal entries, and bookmark entire pages as they read the electronic version of the scriptures online. This Study Notebook is integrated for other resources too -- conference talks, magazine articles, lessons -- so as you're studying the gospel, you can start to annotate and save content, you can add thoughts of your own. And you can organize all of this into various "collections" as well as tag the content with keywords, much like I tag this post with keywords.</p>
<p>This transition seems innocent enough -- you're reading the same texts, after all, just in another format. However, don't underestimate the impact of the format on the experience and interpretation. Moving the reading experience online changes one's experience from deep, immersive reading to a more fragmented, thematic approach. With an online format, we have the hyperlink, our favorite challenge to reading accessibility. Every hyperlink poses a forking path for the reader, requires a decision. With the slightest boredom, the reader clicks elsewhere, and elsewhere, and elsewhere, until the reading experience has become chopped up and fragmented, following a reader's whimsical path down many roads of knowledge.</p>
<p>Steven Johnson makes some of these observations as he reads a novel on a Kindle while waiting for his food at a restaurant.</p>
<p>Because they have been largely walled off from the world of hypertext,  print books have remained a kind of game preserve for the endangered  species of linear, deep-focus reading. Online, you can click happily  from blog post to email thread to online New Yorker article -- sampling,  commenting and forwarding as you go. But when you sit down with an  old-fashioned book in your hand, the medium works naturally against such  distractions; it compels you to follow the thread, to stay engaged with  a single narrative or argument.</p>
<p>Johnson's essay echoes the same argument Nicholas Carr makes about Google making us stupid. Carr explains that he finds that his own book reading habits have been altered by his online reading. The more he reads from Google, that is, online linked text, the more he finds his attention span shortens, his reading becomes shallower. He no longer has the patience to plow through a long printed book like he used to.</p>
<p>A few months back, I entered the debate of online links, which Summerhays and Redish had argued was destructive to low literacy accessibility. Clearly the format introduces new challenges. Whereas the move from scrolls to books introduced canons and chronology, the move from print to online reduces attention and fragments deep immersion.</p>
<p>Online reading also tends to incline readers toward more thematic paths. Johnson</p>
<p>Johnson notes another dimension of the online reading experience: the social component. Not only do you read the text the author wrote, you can also read others' comments on the text. And you can participate in the conversation, trading ideas with other readers about the text. Coming back to the Study Notebook tool I mentioned, this social component is planned for a future phase. Eventually I'll be able to share my collections and tags with others as an RSS feed. When I first learned about this, I was elated, but the SME sooned raised a yellow flag on my enthusiasm by noting that in the hands of the wrong person, a compilation of tags and notes could be harnessed in a negative and damaging way. Imagine a collection of all the teachings from leaders that have been retracted. Still, I think a personal feed of collections and tags will eventually see light.</p>
<p>Adding a social component to the reading experience transforms the reading experience in at least a couple of ways. Rather than a passive intake of knowledge, readers are compelled to analyze and interpret as well, to be more active thinkers. Social components in the format of comments and trackbacks also democratize written material by allowing anyone to voice criticisms and reviews of the content. Published material no longer has a hegemony over readers. You can trounce a book's assertions and reject an argument, and gather other readers to your side through your comments.</p>
<p>Johnson writes,</p>
<p>Think of it as a permanent, global book club. As you read, you will know  that at any given moment, a conversation is available about the  paragraph or even <em>sentence</em> you are reading. Nobody will read  alone anymore. Reading books will go from being a fundamentally private  activity -- a direct exchange between author and reader -- to a  community event, with every isolated paragraph the launching pad for a  conversation with strangers around the world.</p>
<p>In other words, the analysis and interpretation that was once somewhat private in the reader's mind is now a collective, community-driven event. To say no one reads alone anymore is true -- you're not alone cuddled up on a couch reading a book. You're in a roomful of people all reading the same pages, with some shouting their opinions as you go.</p>
<p>Whereas the social componet changes the way you interpret and internalize what you read, mobile formats also affect your experience of the text. With mobile formats, the effect isn't so much a social contribution, because mobile devices are primarily consumption devices rather than content creation devices, but mobile devices do introduce a location into the experience. You can supplement original sites with mobile enhancements; you're in a museum listening to podcasts from your mobile device about the artifacts. You're exploring a historic point in a city when you review its associated entry on wikipedia. You're listening to a speaker while also reading about him on a mobile device. The power of the mobile device is to juxtapose location awareness with web content.</p>
<p>Of course mobile devices also have many location-aware apps and gimmicks such as Four Square, but I haven't seen any text that is smart enough to provide customized text based on the person's location -- beyond local service suggestions (from Yelp) or business reviews or language translations.</p>
<p>---------------------------------</p>
<p>what else does mobile do? mobile allows you to fill up the nooks and crannies of of your time with reading experiences.</p>
<p>is there something coming? what could possibly be coming? what is it that would chnage the way you read a text? mass aggregation of sources. the safari library is really ingenius about this and it bears mentioning. you're reading a blog post, and below it are suddenly a dozen other excerpts of this same content from other authors and from different perspectives.</p>
<p>what does this do? this means you can read more directl yby topic. you can get a better feel for a topic from reading. you can go deeper. this perhaps cuts away at the superficiality of reading, becaus eit allows you to go deeper.</p>
<p>what are the disadvantages? too much knowledge at our fingertips? will we see a flourish of culture like with the greeks?</p>
<p>the greeks implement a democracy, and as a result we see a tremendous surgence in all of this. what we're really looking for is this kingpin of transition that induces change. has ht einternet already done it? what will be the result of information saturation? when everything that can be known is known, when information is freely available to all people who need it or want it? what then? what happens to our society? we perhaps shift away from location-based information and move toward a more global society. no more walls. more feedback. there is nohting that no one who wants to know will be restricted from knowing.</p>
<p>walls of learning broken down. this means that perhaps you have more minds on more problems. or you create more problems? want to see information trends?</p>
<p>total engagement. community act, thematic based,</p>
<p>we have this idea in tech comm of single sourcing across so many different format,s but we don't really respect the powe rof these different formats. is it making us a lot smarter? not sure.</p>
<p>maybe there's so much knowledge, we become stupider. not as well read. no knowledge of the classics. the next level? singularity? institutional memory of decisions and actions? all knowledge at your fingertips with the right google search. that bible site that compiles 20 diff translations and all kinds of commentaries. biblios. that kind of expeirence is so coming, so superior.</p>
<p>result: more skepticism, more agnosticism. more awareness. more tolerance.</p>
<p>who was the wisest person ever? solomon.</p>
<p>so much content production, damping and selection. out of all of this content, great content will emerge. you have so many monkeys typing on a typewriter, you're bound to produce a shakespearre. but the transformation is one toward information and away towards fiction. i think that's what people are or hat the internet is moving towards: a source of information that is vast, expansive, that is infinitely deep.</p>
<p>what information gives us is awareness, and awareness helps us be tolerant. but have we seen a reduction of wars since the internet came out?</p>
<p>what about the impact on authoring trends? serial novels? the common man is an author. people not writing for books anymore -- people instead writing for blog posts, hitting a subject somewhat hard briefly? people change their text to undergird it with SEO so that it can be found, because no one can find anything anymore.</p>
<p>explosion of the arts, explosion of philosophy -- how did these come about in greece?</p>
<p>what if the book is eventually replaced by the blog, because peole realize that they can make more money with a successful blog through advertising than with a book, and because book authors know they won't be read that much. when you see the tranditional authors going online, it will spur a movement of more authors to go online. the more trends move online, the more pressure traditional book authors have to publish online. and information online wants to be free, because the model for revenue online doens't work with a paywal. so i see this final trend toward formats as a trend that influences the authoringhip of novels themselves to turn online. as writers use online authoring tools, they're own writing methods will change. shorter paragraphs, chapters, links, categroies, tags, etc.</p>
<p>Stay-at-home mothers obsolete? Those among the 5 million who are alive  and well and reading this may already be clicking indignantly to the  comments section to defend their choices. Go ahead and vent,  stay-at-home mothers. I get it. Fourteen years ago, I struggled with my  own decision amid a tangle of internal and external messages. Some still  seem valid and others now less so, but the difference was hard to tell  amid the hormone-saturated, sleep-deprived, advice-swamped bewilderment  of new parenthood.http://www.salon.com/life/real_families/index.html?story=/mwt/pinched/2011/01/05/wish_i_hadnt_opted_out</p>
