<p>This may be a small observation, but I've noticed that I'm much more engaged by projects where I perceive a high need for user assistance than I am with projects where the help is not so needed. When I can see that there's a definite need for help, my job as a technical writer comes alive. I'm engaged, focused, motivated, and happy. In contrast, those projects where I'm called in to document a system "in case someone gets hit by a bus" are about as fun as clipping someone else's toenails.</p>
<p>I've been lagging with one of these business continuity type documentation projects for a few weeks. One user even told me, "Tom, if you were to write help for this application, I don't know who would actually read it." But today I received a new project, one with a sizable audience and a definite need for help.  As I started gathering information, I decided this time that I needed to immediately identify a handful of users to gather information about the project. I've been on too many projects where I try to get this information from the project manager and QA team, and those projects always spin around in circles. At some point project managers gather requirements from customers, or business analysts do, but by the time the project is ready for the technical writer, it seems like project managers have a misguided and often incomplete idea about the user's needs. It's much better to contact a few users directly to get this information and to bounce ideas off them. I've always been shy about contacting users, but the more I do it, the more I'm convinced about how indispensable they are to writing help.</p>
<p>As I interact with users, I can get a clearer sense about their need for help, and thismakes writing help a more engaging experience. I'm no longer writing for an abstract idea of a group of users wh may or may not need help. I'm writing help for specific people, with a clear understanding of their pain points, problems, and issues they're facing. This perspective, which only truly comes as I interact more clsely with usrs, makes technical writing a fulfilling, enjoble career.</p>
