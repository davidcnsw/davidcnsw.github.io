<p>Hi Katharine, congrats on starting a program in tech comm. If you want, I can create a collaborative post on my site (idratherbewriting.com) titled "What I wish I knew before starting my technical writing career..." and ask people to contribute. I would open by excerpting your question (anonymously). That might make for an interesting angle.</p>
<p>For me, if I were restarting, I would have maybe specialized in API documentation from the start. But I can elaborate more in the post.</p>

<p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>I hope you had a good holiday. I am starting school on Thursday as a Technical Writing student! I am very excited (and nervous) and have been listening to your podcasts/reading your blog in preparation for this new world I'll be hopefully entering into. I have a background in journalism, and enjoy writing and technology - but don't really have the language down at all (thus enrolling in this program.) If you have any advice for a newbie such as myself, please feel free to share :) Other than that, please keep up the great work on your blog - I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Katharine</p>
<p>PS - I wanted to ask you - I have interest in using my powers for good, and would love to learn that there is a place for technical writing within the non-profit sector. In your experience, do you see that being a possibility?</p>
<p>Thanks again. Cheers!</p>
