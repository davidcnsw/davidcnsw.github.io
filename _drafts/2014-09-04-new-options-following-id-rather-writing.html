<p>I've made several enhancements on the ways to subscribe to I'd Rather Be Writing.</p>
<h2>Email</h2>
<p>I've switched from Feedburner to Sendy for email subscriptions. Previously, Feedburner automatically emailed the post out to everyone who signed up for email subscriptions. Sendy is my own email software, hooked up to Amazon Web Services. Sendy is more like Mailchimp or Constant Contact, except that it's a fraction of the price. I have complete control about what I send out, when, and what it contains. </p>
<p>Based on feedback, people would like to be sent just one post, and they want the entire contents of the post included in the email. So it will probably be highly similar to the Feedburner email. However, I can include additional information and links in the Sendy email. I can consolidate information into a monthly newsletter, or send out a special message not related to anything on my blog. </p>
<p>Why did I switch? Two main reasons, really. First, when I imported DITA content into my site, it updated all posts and sent out a Feedburner email of the last 10 posts to people. This was a problem, since I plan to continually import the DITA content from DITA into my site.</p>
<p>Second, Google killed its RSS Reader last year. Feedburner is a Google product that is just waiting to be killed off as well. There are other options for email distribution, such as FeedBlitz, MailChimp, and others. But they cost a heck of a lot more than Sendy. Sendy costs only a one-time fee of $59. Mailchimp costs about $50 a month for a distribution of 2,000 emails.</p>
