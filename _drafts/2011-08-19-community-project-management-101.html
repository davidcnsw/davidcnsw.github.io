<p>One of the most common complaints I hear from community managers is that they can't seem to get their community members doing much work. A project may have upwards of 100 volunteers, but only about 10 actually contribute regularly to fixing bugs, testing the app, and doing other development. Most team members in a project are either observers by role, or they they have adopted an observer/lurker mentality. In fact, some research on open source communities suggests a 90-9-1 rule, meaning 90 percent do nothing, 9 percent contribute intermediately, and 1 percent contribute heavily.</p>
<p>Although this ratio may seem the reality of volunteer work, actually project managers can have much more success if they apply several basic principles to project management. These principles are nothing new, but if followed they will drastically change this 90-9-1 ratio.</p>
<h2>1. Invite a specific person to complete a task.</h2>
<p>Have you ever made a general call for help to a group of people by saying hey, we need someone to fill a cannery assignment this week. Is anyone interested? What kind of response do you get like this?</p>
<p>Here's another scenario that may be familiar. Think about the last time you were sitting in Sunday School when a sister came in and said, "We need a couple of brethren to come help in nursery ...." Almost all the men in the room cringe in silence and try not to make eye contact. In contrast, if she had pulled someone aside and asked me if I would fill in for a missing teacher in nursery, nearly every other man in the room would have accepted.</p>
<p>I recently recorded about 7 interviews at our recent service day. I emailed specific people from my community blog group and invited them to transcribe a video. I received about an 80 percent acceptance response. Those who couldn't take it on were either in the hospital or had other major life situations.</p>
<p>Inviting a person to complete a specific task is the first step towards being productive with volunteers.</p>
<h2>2. Provide assistance and guidance with the task.</h2>
<p>The second major strategy is to provide assistance or guidance to the volunteer so that he or she can complete the task. In my LDSTech Blog project, many of the members are confident writers, but they don't have access to the subject matter experts that they need to talk to in order to complete the task. They don't know who to talk to, how to find out their number, how to hold or record the conversation, and so on. I've found that it's helpful to set up the interview with the appropriate subject matter expert and participate in the interview. This ensures the volunteer has the information he or she needs to start writing.</p>
<p>Some might object that this is a lot of hand-holding, and if I'm going to this much trouble, I might as well just write the articles myself. Or if you're a software development manager, if you go to all the trouble to tackle a bug with a volunteer, why not just do it yourself. True, you're probably more efficient, and if you count up the hours you spend hand-holding, coaching, and otherwise assisting the volunteer, the return might not be worth it.</p>
<p>This is a common misconception that Elder Bednar addresses with a story about trimming his lawn. In a conversation about leadership, Elder Bednar says that he was known in his neighborhood for his well he trimmed his lawn. He had a particular technique for trimming the edges that attracted a lot of how-to questions from neighbors, as his lawn was the envy of the block.</p>
<p>One day his son asked if he could trim the lawn. At first, Elder Bednar was dismissive, but then he realized the foolishness of his thinking (putting lawn care above his family relationships), and decided to let his son try. The first time he trimmed the lawn, his son did a terrible job. Like a bad haircut, it was a complete hack job. Eventually it grew back. The second time he trimmed the lawn, his son did a little better job, and each time he did it he got better until he became completely proficient at it. He then proceeded to teach his brother how to trim the lawn as well. This freed up Elder Bednar to do other tasks.</p>
<p>It's true that at first, the task did require a lot of hand holding. It would have been faster for Elder Bednar to simply do it himself. But if so, he would have always been stuck in that scale, trimming the lawn himself. Now he had trained two of his sons to do the task, and Elder Bednar was free to focus on other matters.</p>
<p>Keep this in mind if you feel you're spending a lot of time hand-holding. You're not just providing assistance and inefficiently wasting your time, you're actually training others to be more proficient in doing the task.</p>
<h2>3. Follow up with the person.</h2>
<p>The final principle is to follow up with the person. Ideally, each task should have a rough deadline, so that you and the volunteer have similar expectations. If a volunteer is doing the task, the timeline might be farther out than you want. Remember that the volunteer is not a paid employee devoting 40 hours a week to your project. The volunteer is devoting a couple of hours a week, maybe more. Allow some extra time for the task to be completed, but by all means follow up.</p>
<p>I've found it's best if you ask the volunteers to let you know when they think they can finish the task. That way the volunteer creates the date, not you. Having a date can be a strong motivator to encourage task completion.</p>
<p>These three principles may not be revolutionary or clever, but they work well. They do require more hands-on management of the project, more time working with the volunteers. But the results are encouraging, and once you get a momentum going, you can start to outperform what you might have been able to accomplish yourself working heads-down on the project, as well as nights and weekends.</p>
