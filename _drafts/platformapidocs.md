* [Eclipse IDE for Java Developers](https://eclipse.org/downloads/)
* [Java SE JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)

To check whether you already have the JDK, open a terminal and type the following:

* Mac: : `/usr/libexec/java_home`
* Windows: `echo %JAVA_HOME%` 

If you have the JDK, you'll see a path to it in the response.
