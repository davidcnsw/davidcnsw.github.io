<p>In my previous post in the DITA series, I talked about conditional processing with DITA, and how it works really well in OxygenXML. By conditional processing, I mean tagging content with attributes such as product="acme", platform="java", or audience="support_engineer", and then applying those conditions to exclude or include the content when you build the help. </p>
<p>The next step is to publish the help. A while ago I wrote a post called "Two competing models: One-stop shopping or specialty sites." With conditional processing, you're certainly faced with this question. What's the best way to publish help material? </p>
<p>My previous post was explored this topic in depth, but while there are pros and cons for both strategies, it was hard to come to a definitive conclusion. Let me return to the discussion for round two in my analysis.</p>
<h2>The "everything on one site" model</h2>
<p>By publishing everything on one site, you can develop the publishing platform more so that it's more rich and functional. One advantage is incorporating facets in the site so that users can filter the search results down by selecting from a variety of filtering options. </p>
<p>In order for the facets to work, you need clear boundaries between the facets. Separating content by product, platform, audience, version, language, and maybe a few other factors seems like a good option here. You'll still end up with topic names that have duplicate titles. </p>
<p>For example, if you have a "Getting Started" topic, you may see the same topic a dozen times if you search for this phrase. Only by narrowing the phrase do you begin to get at the topic you really want. </p>
<p>Here's a site that has an example of facets: docs.huaweai.com. Without faceted filters, amassing all content on the same site would lead to a terrible user experience. </p>
<p>What about separating all content into separate sites? In looking over the number of help files on that site, my guess is that the number of individual sites required for each product to stand alone would be around 50+ doc sites.</p>
<p>I think if the web sets any pattern for tech comm to follow, that model is toward one-stop shopping. Imagine if Amazon.com's homepage presented you with a separate site for each of its different products. That would be somewhat insane. </p>
<p>This trend is probably good news for vendors, because creating a site with faceted filters or creating a site that restricts what users can see based on their login requires extensive development. At this point, you're not just publishing flat HTML files but also applying more sophisticated logic to show or hide content based on logins or selected facets.</p>
<p>1. what are the disadvantages of having everything on one site?<br />
puts more strain to implement findability tools that are advanced.<br />
2. what's your favorite help site?<br />
can't say that i often use the help for any products i own. plugin help files usually. trying to find support for just your plugin is hard as hell.<br />
3. how do mediawiki sites fare without faceted filters? e.g., wordpress codex. lack of the filters is why sometimes wikis ROT.<br />
4. was your emphasis on faceted browsing prescient? yes.<br />
5. are we always going to be at the mercy of vendors? yes.<br />
6. in what ways are facets frustrating? when they aren't clear. when you don't know where something is to begin with.<br />
7. what does mark baker say about facets? need to have clear boundaries for users to make sense of it. depends on the type of material you're publishing.<br />
8. how is religion like facets?<br />
9. how exactly do you set up facets? no idea<br />
10. where do facets break down? users should see only the facets they want to see. maybe if you have too many facets. </p>

initial fascination with science faded<br />
but recently watching naked and afraid<br />
sense of wonder at how man, so weak, survives<br />
are we just another animal, or what? how did those first humans survive with seemingly little skill</p>
