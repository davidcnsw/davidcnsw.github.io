<p>Recently I've been working with a graphic designer to create some icons and diagrams to show a network. As needed, the graphic designer created a firewall, wireless access point, modem/router, laptop, desktop, iPad, and other devices. The graphics look visually appealing, but there's just one problem: perspective. They all have the same head-on perspective. As such, when you arrange them into a network diagram to show their placement in a building, the perspectives aren't right. In fact, I'm convinced you can't create a stylized, three-dimensional network diagram by creating the individual components unless you know the position of each of the components.</p>
<p>I ended up creating a few of my own networking components that looked more like what we needed. But as I was drawing the objects, I realized that I don't understand perspective very well. Perspective is important when making cubes, rectangles, and other computer or network parts. In fact, almost everything is made up of rectangles, triangles, or circles anyway, so being able to draw these various geometric figures in perspective turns out to be a huge skill.</p>
<p>To better understand perspective, I bought Barron's <em>Perspective Drawing. </em>I just wanted to learn the basics of drawing in perspective, nothing particularly fancy. I'm not going to summarize the book, but basically to draw in perspective, you need a horizon line with two vanishing points on each side. The lines of your buildings and other geometric shapes align their edges toward the vanishing lines. Even circles are really just squares that point toward the vanishing lines.</p>
<p>Sometimes your vanishing points are off the page. In that case, you can tape extra pages beside your paper, or even use string. There aren't really vertical vanishing points unless the object is really tall. Here's why. Horizontally, objects acquire a sense of perspective through a diagonal distance. The distance can be quite long. But vertically the distance covered usually isn't so long, unless you want to draw long-ish type objects or capture a scene at a distance.</p>
<p>One of the new tools in Adobe Illustrator is the Perspective Grid. I've played around with this and am fascinated by it. The two-dimensional grid is pretty easy to use, but the three-dimensional grid seems to lack a couple of move points for the horizon line. (I'm still figuring that one out.) What's really fascinating about the Perspective Grid is that you can drag objects onto the grid and then slide them around along the vanishing lines. Nothing could be cooler.</p>
<p>Here's a little video showing the perspective grid in Illustrator.</p>
