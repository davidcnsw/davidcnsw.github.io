But that is neither here nor there. I wanted to get in touch to ask you about your technical writing portfolio. I'm sort of between jobs (well, not exactly, but I will be soon), and I'm going to need to start looking. I'm on LinkedIn (hmm, don't see you there either, do I??). You must feel pretty secure in yourself, I guess... Since I have seen you mention putting up a portfolio...... But, hmm. Oh, I see. You view your website/blog as your portfolio, do you?

Interesting. I think I get it. My purpose in contacting you was to find out how one goes about putting up a portfolio. I mean, I now how it's done on the technical end (a miracle in itself, considering I'm quite the technotard, according to my husband.) But, somehow I managed to finish a tech comm degree and hand-code my own website portfolio. And it really looked okey dokey, I thought. If I do say so myself.

But times have changed in the past 10 years, and now suddenly you have to have a web design degree to make a website of your own. I mean, I still think this technotard could do it, but I want my site to look professional. Indistinguishable from the norm. Hidden, sort of. Do you see where I'm going with this??? Not sure if you've been living under a rock these past 10 years, but, well, I know you haven't, right? I mean, you can tell if something is genuine or not just by looking at its 'face'. Well, I can, anyway -- but I am really smart (no offense, of course).

I like you, sir. We share many ideas in common. About DITA and stuff... I mean, no one wants to be treated like a trained monkey, you know what I mean? Like, even the trained monkeys don't! LOL

So I thought you might understand where I'm coming from here. I want to create a website/portfolio branded using my real name, that links to a blog that has its own name (in the latter case here, I was inspired by you). So thank you for that.

Any advice on how to accomplish this with as little effort as possible? I am a little lazy, I'm afraid. Not that I'm saying I couldn't do it all alone, but it would take me some time. I don't even really know what DITA is, so I'd have to begin there, then learn WordPress (choose a theme or two, a logo for them to share...), figure out a name for the blog part, get some hosting space (I hear good things about BlueHost :P), etc.
