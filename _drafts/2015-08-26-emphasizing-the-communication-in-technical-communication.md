At the last STC Summit, I chatted with Todd Deluca while watching a baseball game. Todd mentioned that lately he's been emphasizing the "communication" aspect of technical communication. By this he meant the communicating of product information out to customers and the general company, increasing awareness of what developers and technical writers are creating.

I hadn't thought much about this role previously. My general attitude is that the information is in the documentation, and if people want to learn about a product, they should consult the documentation. End of story.

But today was really humbling. To address a lack of communication and coordination about information for one of my products, half of the developer team flew to another state to provide a couple of days of classroom training. It made me wonder if the documentation had failed the audience. Couldn't they get this same information from the docs I'd written?

It turns out that very few people actually read the documentation. When people look for information, they tend to consume it on non-documentation-specific ways. When you provide classroom training, the information delivery is much more visual, auditory, interactive, and sequential. In contrast, documentation is mostly textual, silent, one-way, and non-linear.

I want to emphasize the communication aspect of technical communication so that people aren't flying all over the place to deliver information. In an ideal world, when new releases go out, the whole company would be presented with informative, attractive, and easy-to-consume information that enlightened everyone. No one would need to provide special webinars, in-person training, detailed email announcements, or other supplementary collateral.

I'm not entirely sure how to satisfy this need, since I'm strapped enough as it is and don't really have time to be both a trainer and corporate communications and documentation person for a handful of different products.

But I think I could at least make a start by doing the following:

* **Make the documentation much more visual.** When people do training, they make PowerPoint slides. When they make PowerPoint slides, they usually add visuals. If visuals already exist in the docs, they can pull from those diagrams, illustrations, and other graphics to easily create the PowerPoint.
* **Ensure the development team actually reviews the documentation.** Unless developers are actually forced to read and review the documentation, they tend to ignore it. Then when they are asked to provide their own training, they recreate everything (making their own diagrams, explanations, and other materials). If developers were more aware of the documentation assets, they could leverage them when putting together training. I'm thinking conducting doc reviews by creating a wiki page with each developer's name and a list of pages to review. When the dev finishes his or her review, he or she puts his or her initials beside the page. If the grid is blank, it will expose inaction.
* **Blast the company with links to the documentation.** Instead of having the product manager create his or her own version of the release information, why not just send a link to the documentation instead? Or when a support thread comes up with a problem or issue, send a link to the documentation to the thread.
* **Err on the side of too much communication.** It's probably better to err on the side of too much communication rather than too little. I think I'm hesitant to blast everyone with documentation.
* **Understand the audience.**
* **Build an elearning course.**
