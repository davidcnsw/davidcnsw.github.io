<p>In my previous post, I outlined about ten reasons David Weinberger presents to explain why books aren't the best container for knowledge. In this post, I'll add some more reasons.</p>
<h2>Books Force Writers to Fill Blank Pages, Whereas the Network Resizes Appropriately to the Argument's Size</h2>
<p>When you write a book, you have to complete about 70,000 words or so before it's finished. A lot of times, the writer doesn't have that much to say. He or she ends up padding out the pages with fluff to reach the required length. Online, your argument can be as short or as long as it needs to be, without the false sense of completing a certain length. Of course there's value in pushing your thoughts as far as they can go, but I've read plenty of books that get boring because the writer isn't following a long-form argument. The thoughts just keep shifting around with fluff to fill empty pages.</p>
<h2>Books Change the Goal from a Real Purpose to an End In Itself</h2>
<p>One of the primary reasons people write books is for the symbol of achievement. To say you've written a book is kind of like saying you've just ran back to back Ironman Triathlons. It's a remarkable achievement.</p>
<p>But is it?</p>
<p>What one achieves in writing a book is just that: a book. What exactly is the value of a book? Shouldn't our real goal be some change, some tangible result? Rather than saying, I've written a book about X, I would so much rather say, I've changed the way we approach this problem. I've invented a new technique for X that thousands now follow. I've pioneered a new method for solving X. If we put the focus on a result, even if it's a change in attitude or thought, that's a much better goal than "writing a book." The problem is that writing a book becomes the focus of writing a book. The shape for the knowledge becomes more important than the goal of the knowledge.</p>
<h2>By the Time Books Are Published, the Landscape Has Changed</h2>
<p>It takes books months to reach their final publication and distribution. I have a friend who recently finished a book. From the time she finished the book to the release party, when the book will be available, there's about an 8 month gap. Publishing printed articles in magazines has a similar time frame. If it takes half a year or more to go through the publishing workflow, the ideas may be out of date before they are printed. How can books maintain a strong presence as the ultimate container of knowledge when they can't keep up with the rapidly changing pace of knowledge?</p>
<h2>The Cost of Books Excludes a Majority of the Audience. Online Access Includes a Much Wider Audience.</h2>
<p>Books are fine if you have a lot of money to spend, but they cost a lot. Their cost may not be prohibitive, but when you start looking at more specialized books in a particular niche, the cost can rapidly add up. Read a book a week at $20 a book, and in a month you've spent $80 on books alone, which is the equivalent of an unlimited data plan on a smartphone. In developing countries, $80 might be more like $800 given differences of cost of living. If books are only going to cater to the well-off, we exclude a large part of our audience.</p>
<p>Also note that I'm talking about books as if each book you ordered was worth finishing, but we all know that, just as every website isn't worth reading, many books are duds. If you go to a library and peruse the bookshelves, you probably look through a dozen books before settling on several to check out.</p>
<p>Did I say "check out"? Getting check out privileges at a university library is tough. My university won't grant alumni check out privileges. At best, I can enter and read books at the university library but never check them out unless I'm a student. Leaving my family for an evening at the library may sound pleasant to me, but when I return I'll probably find my belongings on the porch.</p>
<p>Overall, books are hard to acquire and access. They certainly exclude a majority of the world.</p>
<h2>The Difficulty of Writing Books Discourages Writing. In Contrast, Chunking Online Makes Writing Easier and Hence More Likely.</h2>
<p>Without a doubt, writing a book poses a monumental effort. It may require several years of constant effort to produce the text in a book. Few people have such time, especially encumbered with family obligations, second jobs, community commitments, and other activities. As a result, they often never start or finish the book. The book's minimum length is just too challenging to accommodate efforts to pump out some knowledge.</p>
<p>In contrast, writing an article on a blog takes much less time â€” an evening at most, usually. As such, millions more people are writing. In fact, something like two million new blog posts are created a day. Let's say the average blog post is 500 words. If you were to divide the word count on two million new blog posts by 80,000 words (an average length for a book), then blogs add the equivalent of 12,500 new books published a day.</p>
<p>Of course, a 500 word blog article isn't nearly the achievement of a book, but what about 140 blog articles each 500 words? That's the 70,000 word equivalent. Again, it won't have nearly the depth or long-form argument of a book, but those articles are better than a book that is never written, isn't it?</p>
<p>Overall, the ease of writing and publishing entices a lot more people to write who wouldn't otherwise be writing. As a result, the knowledge increases much more than if books were the only medium to create knowledge.</p>
<h2>The Length of Books Discourages Reading. Online Chunking Encourages Reading.</h2>
<p>Not only does the level of writing increase when the medium caters to shorter length, the amount of reading also increases. People who don't normally have time to read a book do have time to read a short article online. Blog posts and online articles are consumable because they're in smaller bites. As a result, people are reading more. Just as we're writing more because the tasks are easier, we're reading more because the tasks are easier. You don't have to dedicate hours and hours of time each month to read. You can set aside a few minutes here and there and walk away with key points and ideas.</p>
<h2>Books Limit You to One Medium: Text. The Web Allows for Multimedia.</h2>
<p>Books invariably use the medium of text to convey their ideas. Some books add illustrations and screenshots, which helps. But by and large, knowledge is expressed in the form of text. In contrast, the web gives you more flexibility with other formats, such as video, audio, interactive media, and graphics. When we're talking about containers for knowledge, wouldn't more mediums of expression be better? Just as some topics are better expressed through text, other topics are better expressed through other mediums.</p>
