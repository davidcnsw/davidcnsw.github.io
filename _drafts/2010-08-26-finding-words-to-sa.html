<p>My wife is 5 days overdue. Her feet were so swollen yesterday, I actually grabbed the camera and photographed them. Her ankles? gone. </p>
<p>She will give birth to our fourth girl sometime over the next two weeks. For now, we have just three girls. Beautiful, innocent, smart girls. </p>
<p>In the Mormon church, it's customary for fathers to give their children blessings at the start of a school year. I didn't grow up in the Mormon church, so this was never my tradition. </p>
<p>I became a Mormon when I was 15. I remember another gentleman in our ward asking if I wanted a father's blessing at the start of my school year, because none of the rest of my family were Mormon. I declined, because I didn't really know what it was about, and I didn't want to trouble anyone.</p>
<p>Fast forward 19 years. Past college, the mission, marriage, and the start of a career. Now I have three children of my own, and my wife, who grew up Mormon, was familiar with the tradition of the father's blessing at the start of the school year. She asked if I would give our daughters blessings on Monday evening to start the year. </p>
<p>The father's blessing is simple. You lay your hands on the person's head, pronounce your authority, and then say whatever you're inspired to say. That's the part that makes me a bit nervous -- venturing into that inspired part.</p>
<p>Shannon asked me to get the recorder as well, since you can record father's blessings for your scrapbook. I'm a pro at recording audio, so I had my H4 Zoom all hooked up with a lapel mic attached to my collar in about 5 minutes.</p>
<p>I put on slacks and a white shirt and socks, because even though I was just at home, it seemed appropriate to change out of my usual wear shorts and pajamas. </p>
<p>As we started our family home evening, we pulled a chair into the living room. The middle child, Callie, was nervous. She wanted to go last, after watching everyone else. </p>
<p>The youngest, 3, sat on the chair first. As I laid my hands on Lucy's head, I felt impressions of what to say inside. She would be a guide to her sisters as they got older. Then it was the oldest's turn. Avery had many talents and gifts that she needed to use to help those around her. I gave Shannon a blessing too. I said she had raised these daughters well and shaped our family in righteous ways. I then blessed the middle one, Callie, and said she would bring happiness to her friends and future companion. I had no agenda and no idea what I would say, but each time I said a blessing, impressions just came to me. </p>
<p>Afterwards, the kids were practically jumping with excitement. One shouted from the top of the stairs, You're the best Dad ever. Another said, I wish I could feel this way always. Shannon sniffled and wiped her eyes. It was absolutely the best family home evening ever, and one of my proudest moments as a dad. I felt I had learned something new about each of my children that I didn't know before. I caught a glimpse of the bigger picture, and saw my place and their place in it.</p>
<p>My kids don't realize it, but I'm probably not the best father out there. I spend too much time playing basketball, too much time blogging, and not nearly enough time playing with them. But little moments like these will stand out to me, helping me remember what fatherhood is all about.</p>
<p>When Molly does finally decide to come out of Shannon's belly, I am excited to learn who she is, and what she might become. </p>
