<p>A few weeks ago, I came into the office on a Monday morning and, as usual, asked my colleague about his weekend. He said, I don't know how you do it. You manage to find time to write several blog posts a week, do WordPress consulting, ride your bike to work, play basketball, and also spend time with your family. I barely have time to do anything.</p>
<p>Over the years, I've been asked this question a lot. Although I posted the <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2013/01/17/top-10-most-frequently-asked-questions-about-technical-writing/">top 10 questions about technical writing</a> last week, I didn't include answers to this more personal question about productivity: <em>How do you do it all?</em></p>
<p>The question always surprises me, because I don't feel that I do much. Mostly, my frequent blog posts give that impression.</p>
<p>However, more and more we are being asked to do it all in our roles as technical writers. I mentioned the concept of velocity in a previous post, and the need to be quicker with all our processes. We're being asked to do more in less time, to produce content faster in shorter duration, to turn around deliverables the next week. How can we do it all?</p>
<p>Here are a few key factors that have lead to higher productivity in my life.</p>
<h2>Balance</h2>
<p>First, it's tremendously helpful to have married my wife Shannon. She pushes me forward in more ways than I realize. Last weekend, she and my oldest daughter went on a three-day winter campout with the Girl Scouts. Without her presence, I found that I spent a lot of time on the computer. The whole world around me faded into oblivion, and at one point, I stopped typing and thought how one-dimensional my life would be without her and my children. They add the dimensions to my life in ways I don't often realize.</p>
<p>Sure, family sometimes "gets in the way" of what I'm working on or what I want to do. But the very detours that get in the way become the most interesting parts of the journey. Balance helps you not only avoid burnout, it enriches your perspective with different points of view and experiences.</p>
<h2>Drive</h2>
<p>Second, it's essential to be driven by something. I don't force myself to write. Sure, I've had to goals in the past to write a certain amount. But at some point, writing this blog became something else. I needed to write in order to clear my mind. Writing a post was the way I relaxed. It became the way I processed my experiences and thoughts. Without this blank canvas to paint words on, I would be lost in a fog. Writing aligns me, helping me organize my thoughts and giving me a way to explore issues in creatively fulfilling ways.</p>
<p>Some people tell me my posts are too long. I don't dispute that a 2,000 word post can be a chore to read. If I were writing just for an external audience, I wouldn't adopt the style of a personal essay. I would write 200 word link-summary posts. Instead, I write essay posts because the style suits my mentality. Short posts don't usually contain enough depth to show engagement, in my opinion, and it's the depth that interests me. Without this engagement, I wouldn't have a drive to write.</p>
<h2>Habit</h2>
<p>My third secret to productivity is habit. In college, I found a quote by Erasmus, a sixteenth century humanist, that I always found intriguing. He said, “The desire to write grows with writing.” In other words, the more you write, the easier it becomes to write.</p>
<p>Writing is an activity that generates its own forward momentum. Develop a habit of writing, and you start coming up with more and more ideas. Write a post one night, and the next day more ideas pop into your head to explore.</p>
<p>The opposite is also true. If you let two weeks pass without writing, your well dries up. This is why Seinfield continues to perform stand-up comedy on a weekly basis: because he knows if he stops, the neurons in his brain stop connecting jokes, the comic synapses stop firing humor.</p>
<p>Your muse isn't something that comes and goes without any predictable pattern. The more you write, the stronger your writing muse speaks to you. The motivation to write becomes stronger, your ideas more plentiful.</p>
<p>This is why some writers, like Scott Nesbitt, will <a href="http://scottnesbitt.net/weblog/2012/10/08/more-ideas-more-unfinished-work/">say</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the last few months, ideas for articles and posts and other writing have been filling my brain. My cup runneth over and all that. So much so that I've been dumping them into the tools that I use, and then filtering out the ideas that don't seem to have a chance of working.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think the whole writing process has a lot of mystery to it, especially essay writing. Certainly if you're just typing typing instructions for products, you may not feel this way. That's just one kind of writing. But writing as a tool for thought has the ability to extend our minds in ways that advance ideas, helping us discover — from within — concepts we weren't yet conscious of. Writing helps us reflect on and articulate the meaning of our experiences. And this articulation and thought formation reflects back upon us to move us forward.</p>
<p>Ultimately, through writing, we teach ourselves what we don't know! And it happens almost every single time I click <em>New Post. </em></p>
<p>If you read my blog, you'll see me explore my experiences. I plan to keep writing until I'm no longer able. And maybe at that point, I'll sit back and start reading my posts, one by one, and see how these words have formed the connecting dots that drew the path of my life.</p>
