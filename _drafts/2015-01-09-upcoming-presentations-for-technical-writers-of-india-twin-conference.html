<p>I'm giving the following presentations at the [tcworld India in March 2015](http://conferences.tekom.de/tcworld-india-2015/.</p>
<h2>API documentation best practices</h2>
<p>Most of the common tools for publishing help material fall short when it comes to API documentation. Much API reference documentation (such as for Java, C++, or .NET APIs) is generated from comments in the source code using tools such as Javadoc or Doxygen.</p>
<p>REST APIs are a breed of their own, with almost no standard tools for generating documentation from the source. The variety of outputs for REST APIs are as diverse as the APIs themselves, as you can see by browsing the 12,000+ web APIs on programmableweb.com.</p>
<p>Some APIs have dynamic endpoint generators built from tools such as Swagger or Mashery I/O Docs to demonstrate the REST API endpoints in action based on values that users input.</p>
<p>There's a lot to learn to navigate the API landscape. In this workshop on best practices, you'll learn everything you need to get going in the right direction to document APIs, such as</p>
<ul>
<li>How to comment source files with the right syntax</li>
<li>How to generate Javadoc and Doxygen from source files</li>
<li>How to convert in-source comments into DITA</li>
<li>How to make requests with a REST API</li>
<li>How to use cURL from a command line</li>
<li>How to create an interactive UI through Swagger</li>
</ul>
<h2>Creating code samples for API documentation</h2>
<p>Good code samples are arguably the most important aspect of developer documentation. Code samples often show how to use an API or SDK in a real scenario with a particular user goal in mind. These code samples make up the bulk of the developer guides that accompany API reference information.</p>
<p>Whereas the reference information simply lists all the classes, functions, or methods of an API, the accompanying developer guide shows users can leverage different elements of the API to achieve a specific task-oriented goal. When you create code samples, you format the code in a readable way, include comments, precede or follow the code with detailed explanations, and often visualize the results of the code.</p>
<p>In this session, you will learn the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What separates good code samples from bad code samples</li>
<li>Best practices for adding comments in code</li>
<li>How to integrate code samples alongside other API or SDK information</li>
<li>How to gather and review code samples with engineers</li>
</ul>
<p>Although documenting code samples may seem intimidating, diving into this field opens up a new landscape of learning, language, and capability. Documenting code and writing for developers presents technical writers with the ultimate challenge for simplifying complexity.</p>
<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>Tom Johnson is a senior technical writer for the 41st Parameter, a company in the fraud detection and advertising technology space. Tom's blog, I'd Rather Be Writing (idratherbewriting.com), is a hub for innovation and exploration in the tech comm field.</p>
<p>Tom recently guest edited an issue of the STC Intercom (September 2014 issue) that focused entirely on API documentation. In his current role, he provides documentation for Java, C++, and .NET APIs, in addition to other developer documentation. In a previous company, he worked on documentation for a REST API and JavaScript SDK.</p>
<p>Tom lives in San Jose, bikes to work, and has four girls. You can contact him at tomjoht@gmail.com.</p>
