<p>I'm almost certain I'm not the first one to ask this. I am retiring after some 30+ years working for a large corporation, most of that time within IT. I want to parlay my skills into a second career as a Tech Writer. Many of the job postings ask for writing samples. Everything I have is considered 'proprietary'  which means that I am not allowed to share it with anyone outside the company. I've thought of using a trick of content managers and masking the information but I'm not sure this is an effective way to showcase my work. Do you have any suggestions on creating a portfolio? Thank you!</p>
