<p>This page offers a digital portfolio of my work. I included several categories of writing: articles, web projects, technical writing, marketing mailings, and press releases. I also added some explanation about why I selected these pieces.</p>
<h2>Articles</h2>
<h3>"Podcasting: A New Layer of Communication"</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/intercomjan2007.jpg" alt="Intercom" title="Intercom" align="left" hspace="5" /> I wrote this article for the <a href="http://stc.org/intercom/pdfs/2007/200701_12-16.pdf" target="_blank">January 2007 issue of STC 's <em>Intercom</em> magazine</a>. The article explores how podcasting can be used as another tool in your mix of marketing deliverables. To research the topic, I created <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com" target="_blank">my own podcast</a> and learned quite a bit in the process.</p>
<p>Here's an excerpt from the article: "Podcasting refers to audio files on the Internet that you can download to your MP3 player and listen to on the go. You can add files to your MP3 player the old-fashioned way—by downloading the files and dragging them into your player—or you can use podcatching applications such as Juice, iTunes, or FeedStation to automatically download your subscribed podcasts to your computer.</p>
<p>"The idea is that you wake up in the morning and find that your podcatcher has downloaded the latest content, which you can easily transfer to your MP3 player. Then as you make that long commute to work, run on the treadmill at the gym, or take a relaxing walk in the park, you pop in your earbuds (or, in your car, switch on the FM transmitter) and listen to your podcasts." <a href="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/2007/03/podcasting.pdf" target="_blank" title="Podcasting">(Read the PDF.)</a></p>
<p>One reader liked this article so much she wrote me saying, "Tom, I just finished reading your article entitled Podcasting: A New Layer of Communication in Intercom. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and learning more about Podcasting. It was one of the most informative, best written, and practical articles I've read. After reading it, I am ready to go get the equipment I need to Podcast, download some Podcasts, and start enjoying this medium.</p>
<p>"Your article explained how to do it all! And if my company decides they need something like this, I'm ready to create it for them. I think it would be great if all the STC chapters loaded their chapter meetings into Podcasts that we could listen to."</p>
<h3>"Corporate Blogging and the Technical Writer"</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/bloggingintercom.jpg" alt="Intercom" title="Intercom" align="left" hspace="5" />This was my first article in <em>Intercom</em>, and it was somewhat of an experiment. I did at least half of the research by listening to podcasts on blogging, and then I wove together the quotes with my own analysis and commentary. It worked well and was selected as the cover story in <em>Intercom </em>for the <a href="http://www.stc.org/intercom/PDFs/2006/20069-10_4-7.pdf" target="_blank" title="Corporate Blogging article">Sept./Oct 2006 issue</a>.</p>
<p>Here's an excerpt: "Though it may be a small percentage of all blogging, corporate blogging is rapidly gaining popularity as a way for companies to connect with their customers and increase internal communication.</p>
<p>"About 5 percent of Fortune 500 companies are blogging, particularly IT companies, according to the Fortune 500 Business Blogging Wiki. The biggest bloggers include Sun Microsystems, with 2,000 employees blogging, and Microsoft, with approximately 3,000 bloggers." <a href="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/2007/03/corporateblogging.pdf" target="_blank" title="Read the PDF.">(Read the PDF.)</a></p>
<h3>"Should You Sit Near SMEs?"</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/techcraft1.gif" alt="Tech Craft" align="left" height="105" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="145" /> This is a small article I wrote for TechCraft -- an online newsletter for the Technical Writers of India mailing list. Although the article is brief, the concept is crucial: proximity is a major factor in communication with SMEs and users. Here's an excerpt: "I recently had the experience of sitting in contrasting locations on IT projects: first in the same cube as the lead subject matter expert (SME), and then in my own cube in another room, separated from other SMEs. As a result, I've thought a lot about where technical writers should sit during an IT project."</p>

<h3>Cut &amp; Paste: "Top 5 Podcasts for Technical Communicators"</h3>
<p><a href="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/2007/10/07sepoct_cover.jpg" title="Sept/Oct 2007 Intercom"><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/07sepoct_cover.jpg" alt="Sept/Oct 2007 Intercom" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" /></a> Intercom asked me to recommend the top 5 podcasts for technical communicators. They ran my  recommendations in the Cut &amp; Paste section of the Sept/Oct 2007 Intercom.</p>
<p>Settling on just 5 podcasts was agonizing and I thought about it for weeks, constantly drawing up lists and ranking them. I actually submitted 10 podcast recommendations, hoping they would say okay we'll publish 10, but they whacked it down to just 5.  So I also <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2007/09/21/my-stc-intercom-article-top-5-podcasts-for-technical-communicators/" title="My recommended podcasts">wrote a post</a> listing the other podcasts I couldn't include in the article.</p>

<h3>"Adding a Blog to Your Chapter Website"</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/tieline.gif" alt="Tieline" style="width: 188px; height: 51px" title="Tieline" align="left" height="51" hspace="5" width="188" />When I converted the <a href="http://stc-suncoast.org" target="_blank" title="Suncoast STC website">Suncoast chapter website</a> into a blog, it caught the attention of several STC leaders and they asked me to write up an article for the April 2006 edition of <em>Tieline </em>(a publication for STC leaders).</p>
<p>Here's an excerpt from the article: "The many advantages of blogs make the medium too attractive to pass up. The content is XML-based and each post is formatted in an RSS feed. RSS feeds allow your content to be automatically syndicated across hundreds of sites and newsreaders.</p>
<p>"Readers can subscribe to your site's feed and receive the content in their newsreaders (some examples of newsreaders are Bloglines, Google Reader, NewsGator, and FeedDemon). This capability allows you to bring the site to your readers, rather than waiting for them to come to you." <a href="http://www.stc.org/stcmembers/tieline/tie0604/tomJohnson01.htm" target="_blank" title="Tieline article">Read the article</a></p>
<h3>"Social Rules for Creating a Style Guide"</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/techwr-l.png" alt="Techwr-l listserv magazine" title="Techwr-l listserv magazine" align="left" hspace="5" /><a href="http://www.techwr-l.com/articles/writing/socialstyleguide" target="_blank"></a> After participating in an effort to update our department's style guide, I learned a lot about the social aspects of change in a department. This prompted me to write an article about the social rules that one should follow when changing a department style. The article was published in the March 2005 edition of <em>TECHWR-L Magazine. </em></p>
<p>Here's an excerpt: "Creating a style guide may initially seem like a terminology affair ('option button' or 'radio button' — pick one), but the real challenge lies in persuading the department to adopt new style principles.</p>
<p>"Some writers will feel threatened by change, and respond in bizarre and unpredictable ways. Whisper campaigns and ambushes may lie in wait for you. Beware, innovative editor! Before you even think about the literary details of style, prepare to do battle with the true Goliaths and Grendyls: the department itself. By following these five rules below, you can avoid an unexpected apocalypse when you reveal the new guide." <a href="http://www.techwr-l.com/articles/writing/socialstyleguide" target="_blank" title="Techwr-l article">Read the article</a>.</p>
<p>Rereading it, I made it more sensational than it probably should have been. As an interesting sidenote, TECHRW-L recently converted their site into a Drupal blog, and they featured my blog feed in their list of <a href="http://www.techwr-l.com/aggregator/categories" target="_blank" title="Techwr-l site recommends">interesting and relevant sites.</a></p>
<h3>"10 Types of Expats"</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/expats.jpg" alt="expats" title="expats" align="left" hspace="5" />After living in Egypt for two years, I ran across hundreds of different expatriates, and I began to see patterns emerge. I couldn't resist writing about it. This article was published in the May 2004 edition of the <em>Expat Exchange.</em></p>
<p>Here's an excerpt describing one type of expat: "<em>The Drifter: </em>She decided to take a year abroad, not because she has specific plans to study Arabic or network ties at US AID, but because it 'looked like a good option at the time.'</p>
<p>"She finds herself sometimes wandering aimlessly about the streets, not really committed to any particular plan or agenda. She is just as happy to meet a local as another foreigner. In the back of her mind she believes in fate and destiny, though she may just shrug her shoulders about this if confronted.</p>
<p>"She hopes that something greater than herself has pulled her here. Around every corner she is waiting for that force of destiny to manifest itself in a convincing way. The drifter is your friend, but she is everyone's friend as well, because she is secretly searching for meaning, and wondering if she can find it with you, or with the person next to you." <a href="http://www.expatexchange.com/lib.cfm?articleid=1539" target="_blank" title="Expat article">Read the article</a>.</p>
<h3>"John Bascom: Reviving Cowboy Reality"</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/spring99byumagazine.jpg" alt="BYU Magazine" title="BYU Magazine" align="left" hspace="5" /> I'm digging back a few years with this article, but it was a memorable one. In college I worked as a writer/editor for the alumni house, and as such I published a number of alumni profiles for the web, newsletter, and magazine. This article and one other appeared in BYU's Spring 1999 magazine.</p>
<p>Here's an excerpt: "Beyond preserving cowboy culture in art, Bascom combines an interest in Church history with his love of the old West by organizing weekend cattle drives. The drives he creates give cowboy aficionados a taste of the realities of the West.</p>
<p>"In one drive, for example, three riders were temporarily lost downstream during a river crossing. 'A lot of those who romanticize Western culture probably don't find themselves wanting to live it full time,' he [Bascom] says. 'They probably appreciate their cushioned chair back in the office a little more.'" <a href="http://magazine.byu.edu/?act=view&amp;a=257" target="_blank" title="alumni profile">Read the article</a>.</p>
<h2>Web Projects</h2>
<p>The following samples demonstrate various web projects I've completed. In some cases, I created the site and the content. In others, I supplied just the text and structured the flow of information.</p>
<h3>STC-Suncoast Chapter site</h3>
<p><a href="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/2007/07/suncoastsite.gif" title="Suncoast website"><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/suncoastsite.gif" alt="Suncoast website" title="Suncoast website" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" /></a> As webmaster, I transformed the previously static site for the Suncoast STC chapter into collaborative WordPress chapter micro-CMS/blog to encourage more community participation from the members. The site helped chapter members interact more, and it removed the publishing burden from a single individual.</p>
<p>It was also fun to join the Web 2.0 world, where content is driven by users. This site was one of the first STC blogs; now there are probably 10-15 chapter and special interest group blogs. When I create a WordPress site, I usually modify an existing theme's style, design, and organization until it matches my users' needs. <a href="http://stc-suncoast.org" target="_blank" title="Suncoast STC website">http://stc-suncoast.org/</a></p>
<h3>Tech Writer Voices</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/twv.gif" alt="Tech Writer Voices" title="Tech Writer Voices" align="left" hspace="5" /> Another WordPress site, Tech Writer Voices features regular podcasts on technical writing (I create or edit most of the podcasts). The site includes an embedded audio player, a FeedBurner feed, comments, and a sidebar of information. Each audio file has been edited and optimized as an MP3 file for downloading. The podcast feed also syncs with iTunes. <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com" target="_blank" title="Tech Writer Voices podcast site">https://idratherbewriting.com</a>.</p>
<h3>Sago Broadband</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/sago.gif" alt="Sago" title="Sago" align="left" hspace="5" /> SAGO Broadband provides information about broadband services for a data center company offering digital phone, TV, and Internet. I created the text and flow of information on the site. A web designer created the site and graphics. I also created about 5-6 marketing mailings/brochures for this company's products, which I listed in a section below. At least a year after I created the site, the marketing department switched hands and the company's product line changed. With that change, their site was also overhauled. <a href="http://www.sagobroadband.com/">http://www.sagobroadband.com/</a></p>
<h3>Writer's Site</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/overley.gif" alt="Overley" title="Overley" align="left" hspace="5" /> This simple writer's site required quite a bit of back-end configuration with add-on domains, domain transfers, and other site tweaking (it too is from an existing theme). It is also a WordPress site and includes a Paypal-driven shopping cart so users can download the writer's essays after paying. <a href="http://www.maryoverley.com" target="_blank" title="author's site">www.maryoverley.com</a></p>

<h3>Home Health Works</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/homehealth.jpg" alt="home health" title="home health" align="left" hspace="5" />Home Health Works is a home health agency site. Its purpose is to inform readers about home health care for the elderly and disabled. I wrote the content for the site and arranged the flow of information; a web designer put together the graphics. <a href="http://www.homehealthworks.com" target="_blank" title="Home Health Works">www.homehealthworks.com</a></p>
<h3>Flickerbait</h3>
<p><a href="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/2007/03/flickerbait.gif" title="Flickerbait"><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/flickerbait.gif" alt="Flickerbait" title="Flickerbait" align="left" height="76" hspace="5" width="303" /></a> I met the client for this site while I was actually fishing on the South Pier in St. Petersburg, Florida. I later used his lure and caught a ton of mackerel (while they were still in season).</p>
<p>He wanted to use Yahoo Merchant's shopping cart for the site, so I also used Yahoo's accompanying SiteBuilder product to design it. After interviewing him about the lures, I wrote the content, created the banner graphic and took pictures of <a href="http://flickerbait.com/images/newfinaljuly5-resized3.jpg" target="_blank">some of the lures</a>, rocket weights, and fish. <a href="http://flickerbait.com" target="_blank" title="Flickerbait site">www.flickerbait.com</a></p>
<h3>HD Interactive</h3>
<p><a href="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/2007/07/hd.gif" title="HD Interactive"><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/hd.gif" alt="HD Interactive" title="HD Interactive" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" /></a> HD Interactive is a web development company specializing in interactive multimedia. I created most of the copy that appears on the What We Do button (HD created the Flash site and impressive demo reel). I also edited and structured the content in the Home section to be more readable online.</p>
<p>Here's an excerpt: "Appealing designs begin with appealing illustrations. We begin with pencil sketches, and after adding color, vector curves, perspectives, shadows, and detail, these sketches come to life as fully developed, eye-catching images that add character and originality to your project." <a href="http://hdinteractive.com" target="_blank" title="HD Interactive">http://hdinteractive.com</a></p>
<h3>Deer Hill Expeditions</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/deerhill.gif" alt="Deer Hill Expeditions" title="Deer Hill Expeditions" align="left" hspace="5" /></p>
<p style="margin-right: 10px">Deer Hill Expeditions is a summer youth expedition organization. I edited most of the descriptions of the outings for their 2006 catalog, making the language more vibrant, inserting action verbs and more descriptive imagery. Much of the catalog text still remains on the website. A web designer created the site and accompanying graphics.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 10px">Here's an excerpt of text I edited (it describes the itinerary of one expedition): "Returning to foot travel, you backpack 11 days through meadows of wildflowers and rushing streams, snowfields and 14,000-foot peaks. The Weminuche is Colorado's largest wilderness area, with some of the highest peaks in the lower 48 states.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 10px">"You learn to plan your route off-trail using map and compass, reading topography and assessing mountain weather. You stop to rock climb in a high mountain valley — climbing, belaying, and rappelling on rock walls of varying difficulty. One morning, you take a deep breath and make a summit bid for one of the majestic peaks that surround you." <a href="http://www.deerhillexpeditions.com" target="_blank" title="Deer Hill Expeditions">www.deerhillexpeditions.com</a></p>
<h3>Pozitive Energy</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/label_sm.jpg" alt="Pozitive Energy" title="Pozitive Energy" align="left" hspace="5" /> This product is an energy spray — you pump a few sprays into your mouth and it's supposed to pick up your energy. A graphic designer created the product label, and I created the product copy and ingredient descriptions.</p>
<p>Here's an excerpt: "Rather than relying on heavy doses of caffeine or sugar to wake you up, Pozitive Energy contains an arsenal of B Vitamins and other natural ingredients to kick-start your body.</p>
<p>"B Vitamins are co-factors in the creation of your body's ATP molecules. These ATP molecules actually store your body's energy. When you pump a few sprays of Pozitive Energy into your mouth, Pozitive Energy boosts your cell energy and improves your nerve transmission." <a href="http://www.pozitiveenergy.com" target="_blank" title="Pozitive Energy">www.pozitiveenergy.com</a></p>

<h3>Life Works Wellness Center</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/lwwc2.jpg" alt="LifeWorks Wellness Center" title="LifeWorks Wellness Center" align="left" hspace="5" />I had to read a book by Suzanne Somers to research the copy for this Life Works Wellness Center description on natural hormone replacement therapy. It turned out to be a fascinating subject.</p>
<p>Here's an excerpt: "Natural Hormone Replacement Therapy can replace the hormones your body loses — the estrogens, progesterone, and other hormones — with hormones bioidentical in nature to those you lose.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 10px">"Most individuals experience an almost immediate benefit with bioidentical hormones. Within several days you will begin to sleep better, and the hot flashes will go away. Weight regulation and lost sex drive will also begin returning to normal. " <a href="http://www.lifeworkswellnesscenter.com/nhrt.asp" target="_blank" title="LifeWorks article on natural hormones">Read the article</a>.</p>
<h3>"Six Key Facts About Protein Everyone Should Know"</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/biobuildeheader-copy.gif" alt="BioBuilde" title="BioBuilde" align="left" hspace="5" /> Getting the facts and details of protein straight took me hours of research and mental organization. I didn't know it at the time, but my next employer, who happened to have a PhD in biology, hired me because she liked this article so much. <a href="http://www.bodyhealth.com/html/biobuilde/key.asp" target="_blank"></a></p>
<p>Here's an excerpt: "Amino acids not synthesized into protein become converted to calories or energy. However, converting protein to calories or energy requires your body to strip the amino acids of their nitrogen atoms, creating nitrogen waste. This nitrogen waste from the metabolized protein arrives at your kidneys as a toxic 'urea,' and must be filtered out." <a href="http://www.bodyhealth.com/html/biobuilde/key.asp" target="_blank" title="BioBuilde article">Read the article</a>.</p>
<h3>Ten Steps to Writing an Essay</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/essaybanner.jpg" alt="10 Steps" title="10 Steps" align="left" height="75" hspace="5" width="375" /> This was one of my first websites, and I created it with Dreamweaver as an accompaniment for my composition classes while I taught at the American University in Cairo. It's an extensive how-to site for writing an essay, and includes interactive exercises and instruction on a variety of composition topics. I'm amazed at how popular the site still is. It gets an average of 1,500 hits a day.</p>
<p>When I wrote the home page, I search-engine-optimized the copy, so if you google <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=steps+essay&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a" target="_blank">"steps + essay"</a> it's the first return on the list. This site makes me realize how impressions on the web left long ago can remain just as fresh as if we'd made them yesterday.</p>
<p>The university later changed the site's banner (which now hides some of the side navigation of the home page), and I no longer have access to the file directory, but it's still an excellent resource for learning to write essays.</p>
<p>Here's an excerpt: "When you conduct research, move from light to thorough resources to make sure you're moving in the right direction. Begin by doing searches on the Internet about your topic to familiarize yourself with the basic issues; then move to more thorough research on the Academic Databases; finally, probe the depths of the issue by burying yourself in the library.</p>
<p>"Make sure that despite beginning on the Internet, you don't simply end there. A research paper using only Internet sources is a weak paper, and puts you at a disadvantage for not using better information from more academic sources. " <a href="www.aucegypt.edu/academic/writers" target="_blank" title="composition site">www.aucegypt.edu/academic/writers</a></p>
<h2>Technical Writing</h2>
<p>The online help, how-to guides, release notes, newsletter articles, and other help content I wrote for Raymond James Financial over the past two and a half years are proprietary and confidential, so I can only list the titles. You'll have to trust me that they're well-organized, clear, accurate, succinct, innovative, and extremely helpful.</p>
<p>The guides included a variety of formats and deliverables. Most were written for an audience of financial analysts and home office support staff. Some guides were long (150+ pages) and others short (10 pages). Some involved context-sensitive help, and others were just PDF files. I used RoboHelp, SnagIt, Paint Shop Pro, SharePoint 2007, Adobe Indesign, and Microsoft Word as the tools to produce the help.</p>
<p>Here are some of the titles of the guides I wrote:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>I also wrote newsletter articles, designed templates, modified RoboHelp style sheets and skins, and led department initiatives on single sourcing and online help.</p>
<h2>Marketing Mailings</h2>
<p><a href="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/2007/07/sago.gif" title="Sago Networks"><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/sago.gif" alt="Sago Networks" title="Sago Networks" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" /></a>As a freelance writer for Sago Networks, a data center company in Tampa, I worked with a graphic designer to create marketing copy for a handful of mailings and brochures.</p>
<p>After meeting with the marketing director, who explained the product and intended angle, I conceptualized the copy and drafted each of them. All of these brochures were intended as print material (to be mailed) and not distributed online. Additionally, a lot of them open like a window curtain (parted from both sides). I quickly scanned them below so you can at least read them.</p>
