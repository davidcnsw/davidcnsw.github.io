<p>With a traditional help authoring system, all the help material is confined in one webhelp file. The entry point into the help file is usually through the application's help button. Wikis present a different environment. Unless you have a separate wiki platform for each set of help files, which is highly unlikely, you probably have all of your company's help files on the same wiki platform. Wikis are more like encyclopedias, with articles about different topics all on the same site.</p>
<p>This may be great for centralizing your help material, since it provides one-stop shopping. But now rather than a specialized store that carries just what you want, for example, a shoe store, or a bakery, you have a Wal-Mart Superstore, with as many different products as there are different customers, all together under the same roof.</p>
<p>On our wiki, we have such a variety of content and audiences, it's not uncommon for users to complain that they can't find what they want. One strategy to accommodate such a variety of purposes is to provide different entry points to the body of information. Define the entry point based on the segmentation of your audience. Even Wal-Mart does this. You can enter the Lawn and Gardening door, the Grocery door, the Auto shop, or the "other" door based on what you're looking for.</p>
<p>How many entry points do you provide? At some point, it becomes somewhat overwhelming, but here are a few possibilities for entry points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Roles</li>
<li>Events</li>
<li>Products</li>
<li>Devices</li>
<li>Locations</li>
<li>Purposes</li>
<li>Topics</li>
<li>Index</li>
</ul>
<p>These entry points might be unfamiliar for users, who are probably used to just seeing a list of topics. But entry points are just the starting point. What if you wanted to interrelate these facets, so that users could browse by role and device, or by location and purpose and event? Interrelating these entry points would give users a rich set of data to interact with.</p>
