<p>A few months ago, I wrote that I was finishing my basement -- someday. I was filled with do-it-yourself confidence and had intentions of actually completing it. But as time wore on, I realized that the project was beyond my current capability, and the learning was simply too much. I ended up hiring it out to various friends and contractors. It's not yet finished, but it's getting close.</p>
<p>Even though we were hiring it out, I still did odds and ends down there. For example, I added insulation in all the walls. Stapling batt insulation between studs turned out to be a lot more work than it initially seemed. To prepare for sheetrockers who were coming the next day, I once stayed up until 4 am stapling insulation (while listening to Patrick Obrien's <em>Master and Commander</em> through my headphones). I woke up at 7 am to continuing adding insulation and didn't finish until early afternoon.</p>
<p>By then I was so exhausted that I couldn't do much. My whole body was sore, and my hands felt like each finger had arthritis. I took Ibruprofen, watched some MI-5, ate out, and then crashed for about 12 hours.</p>
<p>My fingers were still sore, but I tried to get back into rhythm. If there's one thing I've learned, it's that my life has a certain rhythm to it. When I get out of rhythm -- for example, when I attended back to back conferences last May, or when guests come over for two weeks, or when I have to manage a huge project like this basement finishing one -- it throws me completely out of my rhythm. The whole computer world becomes foreign. I get hopelessly behind in email, and when I need to type, my fingers don't dance across the keyboard.</p>
<p>When I'm out of rhythm, I forget my goals. I get caught up in the current crisis, and then relapse into TV as a form of exhausted escape. I don't entirely feel in control of the events taking place -- I'm just trying to pass by the obstacles falling down all around me.</p>
<p>Despite the need for keeping rhythms in my own life, I admit there's a certain boredom about always following the same route. After a while, I yearn for something new, for some adventure. This is partly why I'm drawn to mystery and adventure and the spy genre. Sitting at a computer day and and day out seems to lack something.</p>
<p>But as soon as that moment comes, and sweeps me into unknown paths, I lose my rhythm and fall flat on my face.</p>
