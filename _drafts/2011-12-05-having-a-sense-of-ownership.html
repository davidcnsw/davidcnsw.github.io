<p>Last month a speaker at an internal conference talked about having a sense of ownership with your company's products. He compared his experience working in small companies versus working in large companies. The chief difference, he explained, is that in small companies, employees have a greater sense of ownership. For example, in building a website, all employees will exert 110% effort, because the success of the company connects directly with their jobs. If they do a lackluster job and the products fail, the company can easily disappear.</p>
<p>This same sense of ownership is often missing in larger companies, he said. In larger companies, employees treat projects much more like a list of tasks. They may perform the tasks with mediocre effort, without caring a whole lot. After the task is done, they go on to the next task, without any real sense of investment in the products. If something goes wrong, employees can easily point the finger at another group. They can also simply fade into the background.</p>
<p>Although without question, having a sense of ownership helps improve company products, ownership does has some limitations. I think it's possible to extend a sense of ownership too far. For example, if you feel ownership for products outside your assigned stewardship, and even abandon your own assignments to fulfill projects that seem more important, that sense of extreme ownership might be out of line.</p>
<p>In large companies, how do you get employees to take the same level of ownership that they do in small companies?</p>
