<p>In Designing Web Navigation, James Kalbach mentions "adaptive navigation" as another way to help users find what they're looking for. Adaptive navigation is a form of dynamic navigation that emerges based on information gathered from users. For example, when Amazon says, Customers who bought this item also bought," that list of results is dynamically generated based on information gathered from users. If a lot of users buy the book Content Strategy, well, they might also be interested to know what customers like them also purchased.  Kalbach says,</p>
<p>Adaptive navigation is a special kind of a contextual navigation. Its links are generated from a process referred to as collaborative or social filtering. The process relies on an alborithmic ranking of some kind, based on user behavior. The principle is similar to a traditional best-seller list: if many people read something, it msut be good. In this case, link relevance turns out to be a socially constructed phenomenon. (p.94)</p>
<p>Blogs regularly featured adaptive navigation when they present users with options such as, "Most Popular Articles." With the "Popularity Contest" plugin for WordPress, the popularity is determined by the number of hits, links to the article, and comments. You can adjust the weight of each factor.</p>
<p>The New York Times has a section called "Most E-mailed Links." This dynamically generated list is even better than the Most Popular Articles. What articles are people so moved by that they've e-mailed them to others? The top several usually provide appeal.</p>
<p>One reason we may not hear much about adaptive navigation in help systems is because as far as I know, few help authoring tools provide this option. Who wouldn't love to include a note at the bottom of a help topic that says, "Readers who viewed this topic also viewed these topics."</p>
<p>I doubt implementing this feature would be too terribly difficult. Perhaps there's some third-party tool, you could embed some tracking code on projects that would feed information to a database. If anyone knows how to go about this, please share this information in the comments.</p>
<p>Perhaps the appeal of adaptive navigation is that it feels alive. Unlike the other forms of navigation, usually static and defined by an individual who may or may not share your same concerns, adaptive navigation is powered by readers just like you and me. The navigation options are usually more relevant and timely, fitting popular requests. Users know that if an issue is popular among other users, it will likely be interesting to them as well.</p>
<p>Although many navigation options aren't yet available in online help authoring tools (for example, faceted search), it doesn't mean the options will always be excluded. Technology progresses at such a fast rate, it's conceivable that by the time this content reaches you, the solution will already be available. It's good to look forward with an eye towards the future, since this vision often defines our current direction and the processes we define.</p>
