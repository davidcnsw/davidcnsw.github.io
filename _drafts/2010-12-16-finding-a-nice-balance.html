<p>This may sound a little "bad," but I'm going to confess something. Latley I've been convinced of the importance of visual content. Not just screenshots in documentation, but concept diagrams, visuals that communicate technical ideas. Kind of like the one below, which I made yesterday while listening to documentaries on Netflix.</p>
<p>That's the confession part. When I work in Illustrator, I like to listen to documentataries on Netflix. (The presence of National Geographic, Nova, Discovery, documentaries and all five seasons of Prison Break are the only reasons I haven't canceled my Netflix subscription.)</p>
<p>The combination of writing and drawing makes for a nice balance. I find I can only write for so long. But that's okay, because maybe I'm not mean to keep my hands dancing on the keyboard non-stop for hours. When I need a break, I turn to illustrating my writing. Open up a Netflix tab, find a documentary, and wham, suddenly I'm in "fun" mode.Â After I finish the drawing, I'm rested and ready to return to writing mode.</p>
<p>The balance of text and graphics is something I'm betting will be my secret weapon. I'm dedicated to watching three Illustrator tutorials a day on Lynda.com just to refine my expertise with the tool. But technical know-how is only half of it. Much more is the creative imagination to come up with a sketch that means something.</p>
<p>It takes a lot of time to add these graphics. But I'll say one thing: illustrating a concept both clarifies and reinforces the concept tenfold, both for the writer (me) and the user.</p>
