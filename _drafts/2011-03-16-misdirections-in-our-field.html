<p>A while ago I wrote a post called From DITA to VITA. In it I summarized the historical development from a History of DITA article, which describes how we moved to the current DITA standard that many organizations have adopted today. That standard is a minimalistic manual often devoid of anything but brief instructional text output in a PDF and perhaps online format. </p>
<p>A tremendous amount of energy has been placed on single sourcing and re-using content -- so much that content re-use has dominated the tech comm discussion for at least the last 5-10 years. While re-use and single sourcing are important, they haven't healed the "help is useless" problem that users typically feel when they go to help materials. </p>
<p>I do think re-use and single sourcing are good movements forward, but rather than focusing so much effort here, I think technical communicators should focus on strategies for content quality itself, and how users learn material.</p>
<p>Rather than dwelling on one mode of learning -- verbal -- technical communicators should leverage multiple types of learning -- verbal, visual, aural, and experiential. Technical communicators should not only push content into these other learning mediums, but should also look to combine these other learning mediums to improve help material.</p>
<p>My acronym VITA stands for video, illustration, text, and action. It's a simple way of implementing these four modes -- verbal, visual, aural, and experiential. The verbal relates to the written content. The visual relates to illustrations and graphics. Aural relates to instructional sound you hear, such as when listening to a screencast or podcast. And experiential relates to the actions a user takes to generate learning by doing. </p>
<p>There's a fifth learning meme: story. It's not a typical sense, but it exerts a power stronger than the pied piper in pulling and moving an audience.</p>
<p>We place far too energy talking about ways to re-use content in the same mode -- verbal -- without thinking about the larger issue of creating content in these other modes. Rather than ask how you can reuse the same topic in your help system so that you can be a more efficient writer, why not consider how you could integrate a screencast into your help material as well, or how an illustration might work to clarify concepts? You can't single source into the other modes. At best you can leverage some written content to guide you in the other modes, but largely they are additional endeavors.</p>
<p>Why do we focus so much on the technical aspect of content, the re-use and the single sourcing? I think it's because it's easier to focus on this. Moving into other modes requires writers to learn new skillsets, to move out of their comfort zones and to master side skills. </p>
