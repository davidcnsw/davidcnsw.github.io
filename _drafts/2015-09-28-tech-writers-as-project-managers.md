Dear Tom,

>I have not found any notes or material linking technical writing with project management. This question has been running on my mind for sometime now. I have completed my PMP certification and in my current role as documentation lead I have always faced the question of coming out with an exact measurement to develop a manual or work being done by a writer.

>To cut the story short, we have been successful in coming out with our own template after discussion with various stakeholders. I am hoping that I will be able to see certain articles related to project management in your next update:).
