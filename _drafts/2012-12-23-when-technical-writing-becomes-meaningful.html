<p>A lot of people talk about how boring technical writing is, how it's a dull career. You spend most of your time writing documentation no one ever reads, about products you don't use or care about. It's a heck of a way to spend your writing talent.</p>
<p>Yet driving home from work today, I started thinking about how much I like my job, how much I like being a technical writer. Â I started feeling a deep satisfaction about how I spent my time during the day.</p>
<p>I was writing instructions as usual, but recently I'd begun to monitor forum feedback more closely. I'd begun to see the questions people were asking. Some were reading the documentation and finding answers. Others were reading the documentation and misinterpreting it, or not finding solutions. Either way, what I was writing wasn't something that languished in disuse. People read it and commented in forums. I could actually see the effect -- good, bad, or nil -- of my writing activity.</p>
<p>Using this feedback, I made edits, changes, updates. Always trying to move towards greater clarity and precision in meaning. The cycle of writing and feedback, writing and feedback, writing and feedback provides a tremendously satisfying cycle. By feedback I don't necessarily mean direct feedback, but indirect feedback. Knowing that you can make changes, updates, and participate in the ongoing conversation, always moving towards clarity.</p>
<p>The problem is that too frequently, we write in isolation. The key is to move toward a more interactive cycle. You write, and then you examine the forum activity, the metrics, the incoming questions. Can you reduce this? it's like a game.</p>
<p>In order to keep this up, I need to do several things:</p>
<p>* monitor feedback channels for my products, including metrics.</p>
<p>* continue to make updates.</p>
<p>This is the true heart of findability. It's knowing that your first release documentation is a starting point. you can do a lot of little tips and tricks to relate information, but how do you know it's working, how do you know peopl eare finding answers? you have to find a way to measure this, to see the incoming feedback and respond to it.</p>
<p>you've got to better use jira. use that as your lifeline. get your head in meetings. you've got to be the quick tech writer. you push out documentation. you have to be fast and responsive, accurate. you need a system that accommodates this. you already have it.</p>
<p>you've got to understand how each of the projects works, their communciation methodology. two areas you really need to understand better: JIRA and Omniture. And Flare. become really expert at all of these, plus Camtasia Studio.</p>
<p>get your destination thing figured out.</p>
<p>deliver specific user reports to the solutions mangers about usage.</p>
<p>it's not the tools that makes tech writing engaging. it's the interaction with technical information and users. stick with flare. no need to return to wikis.</p>
<p>follow these goals for work:</p>
<p>1. empower missionaries as product SMEs. have them feed you regular information.</p>
<p>2. review forums daily, allegiance daily, and jira daily for a specific number of products.</p>
<p>3. update the help informatoin contineuoslly</p>
