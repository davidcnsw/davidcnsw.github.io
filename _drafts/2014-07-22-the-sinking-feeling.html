<p>I wanted to write about a feeling that I've sensed for some time now. I suppose in many contexts, it's known as an existential angst. The central question is <em>why</em>. Why give me this glimpse of a beautiful world, relationships with other people, life in this complex, interdependent, seemingly magical world, only to lose it all in a puff of smoke when I exhale my last breath?</p>
<p>Coming to grips with the finite nature of the world makes me sad. One day I will die. That will be the end of me. For billions of others on the planet, my death will mean nothing. But it certainly occupies me with a great deal of worry. Probably this worry is what compelled humans through evolution to survive -- because faced with annihilation and nonexistence, we try to overcome all odds.</p>
<p>But what's really the point? It all ends in nothing. We're here for a while. We get to experience life through our senses. For some, life is full of all kinds of wonderful experiences. For others, life kind of sucks. But then one day it just kind of goes away, fading into blackness.</p>
<p>You meet the end one day and it's all over. No one really remembers you. Or if they do, so what? What does it matter to you, because you're gone.</p>
<p>I guess this means that you should really make the most of life while you have it. But what does that even mean to make the most of life? Does it mean to excel at something like programming? All that knowledge goes away at death. Does it mean to bring to the table what you're best at, helping move the human race forward?</p>
<p>What am I really best at? Writing, creative thinking. But what does that actually for me, for us?</p>
