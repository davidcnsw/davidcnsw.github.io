<p>Lately I have been growing fond of taking pictures with my camera. I'm a complete novice with a lens, and I don't pretend to have any special photographic ability. But I wanted to learn more about the principles behind photography (mainly composition), and how those principles compare with writing. Are there commonalities between these two arts -- writing and photography? Should writers who have a unique way of seeing the world automatically have some step ahead in the art of photography? How exactly do the principles of writing differ from photography?</p>
<h2>Some Basic Photography Principles</h2>
<p>Here are a few basic photography principles.</p>
<p><strong>Emotion.</strong> Capturing emotion is key to an appealing photo. Reason being, emotion tends to tell a story. If people are happy, sad, distraught, perplexed, or otherwise wearing their emotions on their face, it tends to make the photo interesting. This is why candid photos are best, because the standard posed, fake-smile photos real emotion.</p>
<p>In writing, style tends to exude emotion. Both style and voice give a sense of persona to writing that helps it come to life for the reader. Emotion is perhaps more important in fiction. A character needs to be driven by some kind of emotion, whether its fear, or ambition, or curiosity. Emotion adds life to writing just as it does a photo.</p>
<p><strong>Contrast.</strong> Contrast can help make photos stand out. Contrast between big and little objects, or vivid colors, tends to contribute to a possible story. Contrast in lighting helps make the photo interesting.</p>
<p>In writing, it's a good practice to contrast sentence structures, making some sentences long while keeping others short. Contrast creates rhythm. Contrast can work well in fiction characters too, since some contrast provides a foil to make each character stand out more.</p>
<p><strong>Perspective.</strong> Photographers try to capture scenes from uncommon perspectives. Either shooting from a low or high angle, or from an uncommon angle, helps make the scene thought-provoking because it helps us see the familiar in an unfamiliar way. In writing, exploring an uncommon perspective is a standard technique for producing an interesting argument. Most essays have a claim. By definition a claim is something everyone doesn't already believe -- it's a position not everyone automatically sees. The exploration of this uncommon perspective leads to a new way of thinking.</p>
<p><strong>Asymmetry.</strong> In composing a photo, photographers avoid placing the focal point in the center. They tend to follow a rule of thirds, placing the subject off to the side rather than in the middle. In writing, it's best to avoid advancing your point direct and center at the reader. Such a technique can be overly moralistic or pedantic. It's better to be subtle, to work in your insights quietly from the side.</p>
<p><strong>Simplicity.</strong> Good photos focus on a single subject and keep things relatively simple. If the photographer tries to capture too much, to bring in too many busy elements or components, the busy-ness detracts from the photos appeal and leaves the reader displeased or confused. Similarly, writing should have a clear focus on a specific topic. Sometimes you have to narrow that focus down quite a bit from something general to something simple.</p>
<p><strong>Direction.</strong> Photos look best when objects point inward, toward the other objects. For example, if someone is looking outside of a photo, the reader's eye follows the gaze of the individual right out of the photograph. In writing, it's best to avoid red herrings or other tangents that take readers away from the central focal point of story. Everything should funnel back or connect with the other elements.</p>
<p><strong>Lighting.</strong> Good photos are well-lit, with soft light illuminating the entire scene, or the focus of a scene. Dim photos, dull photos, or other poor lighting situations take the appeal out of a photograph. It's no secret that natural light is usually an element that makes photos look good. The indoor yellow artificial light makes everything fake.</p>
<p>Similarly, just as you have to go outside to take a good photo, you also have to go outside and experience the world to write well. If you remain holed up in your house, your room, your desk in the library, then you remove yourself from the very experience that will make a good story.</p>
<p>In writing, I'm not sure there's an immediate parallel. But in general, good writing should shed some light on an otherwise unknown or unexplored topic. Writing that trods the same path everyone has already walked down isn't appealing.</p>
