<p>With agile development, you may release an immature product that you intend to improve over a series of short iterations. As such, although you released the product, you don't want to market it yet.</p>
<p>Good content is passed around through tweets, facebook posts, and other links. It doesn't necessarily need a central location that people visit regularly. The social media channels allow the content to live in the ether.</p>
<p>Good content brings together multiple perspectives -- vita. This is similar to Bakhtin's diglossia, only instead of voices, it's with formats.</p>
<p>If your product is agile, your marketing method needs to also be agile. If you take 2 months to create a screencast, by the time you finish it, it's already out of date. Your marketing model needs to be light.</p>
<p>Almost nothing has gone viral that is text alone.</p>
<p>This is an age of content -- content is everywhere. I like the idea of multi-modal content. An interview with someone, a video, a screencast, an infographic. Mix it up. That might be a fun strategy. Don't just stick with words.</p>
<p>Whatever information mechanisms you have in place, you need to be able to change them quickly, on the fly, with little notice. This ability to update information rapidly characterizes the agile method. But also, you can adopt the same agile methods -- testing your content a bit and making adjustments. Your marketing campaign doesn't need to be set in stone a year in advance.<br />
