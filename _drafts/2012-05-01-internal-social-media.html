<p>We have something at my work called “Communities of Practice.” It's a way for disciplines to still communicate and share best practices even when not grouped together in the same department.</p>
<p>The community of practice I participate in is called the “User Education Community of Practice.” I help organize and lead the discussions. I haven't done a great job at it, but today we had a good discussion about methods and tools for professional development. What methods do you use to learn about your discipline? (For example, you're probably reading this blog because you want to stay up to date on trends, issues, and other topics in technical communication.)</p>
<p>We discussed various methods for keeping up professionally. The predominant method for professional development seemed to be personal exploration of tools. For example, one member mentioned that he is learning each tool in the Adobe Creative Suite. We think experimenting with tools is cool. After all, we're technical writers, instructional designers, and other tech people. This is what we do best: figure technical things out.</p>
<p>The discussion took a lot of twists and turns. We explored at length the idea that learning is a <em>risk</em> – you put forward a lot of time, mental energy, and resources learning how to use software that may or may not work out for a variety of reasons. For example, the software may turn out not to fit your situation. Or you may never get funding to implement it.</p>
<p>Someone brought up the importance of learning in context of a real problem. Learning is most effective when applied to a real problem. When using a tool to address a real problem, you're often motivated to learn the tool.</p>
<p>Another member added that it's often the reflection phase where learning takes place. And what better way to reflect on what you're learning than in a blog post! About 90% of the people on my team have blogs, and so this fit right into our group's way of thinking.</p>
<p>This brings me to my point. While maintaining a professional blog helps you reflect and ponder on your discipline, I got to thinking about internal social media. When you blog regularly on a public website about a specific topic, you build up visibility and circle of influence. What would happen if you did the same on an internal blog, one in which only company employees could read?</p>
<p>If social media is powerful on the <em>internet</em>, would it not be equally powerful on the <em>intranet</em>? Some posts would seem to apply equally for outside and inside readers. For example, this post is somewhat transparent, but there's nothing particularly confidential.</p>
<p>If you blog in a space for your company only, how might your blogging topics and style differ?</p>
<p>For starters, I could dispense with the long introductions that get readers up to speed with basic topics. For example, I wouldn't have bothered to introduce what communities of practice are and how they came about. I could have cut straight to the CoP discussion and named the individual departments each participant came from. I could post the recording of the discussion, note the upcoming meeting times.</p>
<p>What's more, I could be much more transparent, frank, and critical of my organization. What would be the repercussions of a post that criticized a work product, or that pointed out ways to improve an internal process? Could I not let things fly with more transparency, irritating some people while also connecting with others?</p>
<p>Of course there are limits to the internal corporate blog. I might not want to throw my boss under the bus, or mention how I think another department should all be fired for their incompetence. But oh what fun this kind of writing might be.</p>
<p>On ways to implement such a social blogging environment, I have oly one model in mind: SharePoint. In our organization, SharePoint is the default infrastructure, and if you've never used SharePoint, it's kind of handy (at times). SharePoint provides an easy web platform to create and manage information. SharePoint 2010 has a feature called “My Site,” which is your own personal SharePoint website. Of course My Site includes a blogging feature. My Site also integrates with the search results of all SharePoint data, so your blog posts, if targeting keywords, might have a widespread reach on searches for those keywords.</p>
