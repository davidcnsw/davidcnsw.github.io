<p>A lot of people are talking about content strategy, and the importance of content. In this discussion, we should not forget that the same holds true for help material: content is king.</p>
<p>Help content is not easy to acquire. Most help material is garbage that is either obvious or irrelevant. A good technical writer, though, finds a path to the real information.</p>
<p>Let's consider at least three types of information in a help file: obvious information, irrelevant information, and aha information.</p>
<p>You find out obvious information by exploring the application on your own. Things you note -- the print button brings up the print dialog box. Export generates a CSV file. Dashboard shows you a summary of all the information at a glance. This type of information may be important for complete novices, but it hardly satisfies the frustrated user.</p>
<p>Another type of information is irrelevant. Tasks that no one needs to do, because they're not part of their workflow.</p>
<p>The final type of information is the golden information. This is the information that you maybe don't initially understand. It's what you figure out in the throes of the SME's office, it's what you find out when you're testing interactions between five different logins. It's the kind of information you gather when you monitor questions from users and start to understand their world and its inherent frustrations.</p>
<p>Getting golden information requires an in-depth analysis of the application. You have to think about advanced scenarios, get inside every nook and cranny of the application to understand it inside and out. You have to tap into the user experience to find out where they're getting stuck, and why. You then ride this bull with all the kicks and jerks to tame the information and articulate it in a clear way. You keep adding it to the help, day in and day out, until you arrive at a more complete set of information.</p>
<p>Golden information isn't something you figure out entirely before release. You figure out a lot of the information after you release the app and start getting feedback from users. They start hammering on every side of the app, and you start digging deeper, looking for more answers.</p>
