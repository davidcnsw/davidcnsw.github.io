<p>In a recent podcast with Joe Malin, Joe said that source control repositories that are able to keep local files in sync with each other is one of the greatest inventions of this century.</p>
<p>[excerpt quote]</p>
<p>This is a really interesting observation. Today I was struggling with a glossary issue and suddenly realized why this these repositories are so ingenius.</p>
<p>Consider this scenario. You have 4 separate doc sets for similar products (Product A, Product B, Product C, and Product D). You have a glossary that you want to share for all four projects. How do you do it?</p>
<p>Approach one. You could try to reference the files using DITA. You could have a folder structure that looks like the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>glossary</li>
<li>project_a</li>
<li>project_b</li>
<li>project_c</li>
<li>project_d</li>
</ul>
<p>To refer to the glossary topic, you would need to write the reference like this:</p>
<p><xref href="../glossary/term.dita" /></p>
<p>And also be sure you include the resource on your ditamap:</p>
<p><glossref keys="division" href="../glossary/division.dita" /></p>
<p>However, you'll get the following error when you do this:</p>
<p>The requested URL /resolve/glossary/division.html was not found on this server.</p>
<p>I don't know if the DITA spec ever mentions this, but DITA has problems with file references outside its root directory. (Subfolders are okay.)</p>
<p>There's a parameter in the webhelp transform that gets around this problem:</p>
<p>fix.external.refs.com.oxygenxml</p>
<p>The DITA Open Toolkit usually has problems processing references which point to locations which are outside of the processed DITA Map directory.<br />
This parameter is used to specify whether the application should try to fix up such references in a temporary files folder before the DITA Open Toolkit is invoked on the fixed references.<br />
The fix up has no impact on your edited DITA content.<br />
Only "false" and "true" are valid values. The default is false.</p>
<p>And then the reference to the glossary term works fine.</p>
<p>Approach two. Use file repository syncing to keep the terms in sync.</p>
<p>Create a central repository for the glossary terms, and then clone the repository inside each of the four projects, like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>glossary (github)</li>
<li>
<p>project_a</p>
<ul>
<li>glossary clone</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>project_b
<ul>
<li>glossary clone</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>project_c
<ul>
<li>glossary clone</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>project_d
<ul>
<li>glossary clone</li>
</ul>
<p>When you want to upate your glossary clone, you browse to the folder location on your command line and enter "hg pull". It syncs all the files.</p>
<p>Now your references in your DITA map just look like this:</li>
</ul>
<p><xref href="glossary/term.dita" /></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><glossref keys="division" href="glossary/division.dita" /></p>
<h2>Which approach is better?</h2>
<p>With the first approach, you have one immutable instance of the content. With the second approach, the glossary clones can be the same, but they can also be forks from the original repository. People can fork the glossary repository and create their own specialized glossaries from that base.</p>
<p>The idea of forking follows common programming practices of inheritance and subclasses. In Java you often have a class that looks like this:</p>
<p>Class Cat extends Animal</p>
<p>Here Cat receives all of the fields and methods of Animal, but it can overwrite them, add to them, and more.</p>
<p>There's a similar concept with "interfaces" in Java. The interface provides blank methods and field names, and then each class that implements the interface basically fills in the blanks for what the fields and methods do (but they can't change the names.)</p>
<p>Of course this is all just the concept of a template. Why start from scratch each time? When you create a resume, you often begin from a template. You have a general resume template that you use to specialize/extend/fork with your own resume.</p>
<p>(Programmers also have classes that can't be overwritten. They're called abstract classes.)</p>
<h2>re-use applications</h2>
<p>What's interesting to me is how source control syncing essentially duplicates the idea of content re-use. Instead of re-using the same topic across multiple projects, you could merely sync a repository with a central repository and achieve the same effect, with added benefits.</p>
<p>Let's approach doc re-use from another perspective. Let's say you're not using DITA. You're using a static site generator like Jekyll. You have 4 projects, and you're reusing topics 1 and 2 across the 4 projects.</p>
<p>reused topics repo<br />
- topic 1<br />
- topic 2</p>
<ul>
<li>project_a
<ul>
<li>topic 1 clone</li>
<li>topic 2 clone</li>
<li>topic 77 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>project_b
<ul>
<li>topic 1 clone</li>
<li>topic 2 clone</li>
<li>topic 45</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>project_c
<ul>
<li>topic 1 clone</li>
<li>topic 2 clone</li>
<li>topic 83</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>project_d
<ul>
<li>topic 1 clone</li>
<li>topic 2 clone</li>
<li>topic 29</li>
</ul>
<p>Here topics 77, 45, 83, and 29 are unique, but topic 1 and 2 are the same.</p>
</li>
</ul>
