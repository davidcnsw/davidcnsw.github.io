<p>For the past couple of weeks, I've spent my time locked away in our recording studio, creating video tutorials. Our "recording studio" is a little usability room that I discovered a few years ago while looking for a quiet place to record. The walls are lined with cloth, there's no fan, and because it's out of the way, there aren't many noises from adjacent rooms. In short, it's perfect.</p>
<p>I recently switched from recording video tutorials on a PC to a Mac. At the last STC Summit, I ran into Matt Pierce from TechSmith, and he gave me a brief demo of Camtasia for Mac. I liked the animation capabilities, so when I returned to work, I asked my manager if we could get a Mac for our recording studio, and he found a way to get me an old Macbook Pro.</p>
<p>Let me tell you, recording on a Mac is much better than recording on a PC -- at least using Camtasia Studio. I hate to surface all the Mac-PC tension, but the Mac is much more stable. On the PC (a Lenovo 520, which is not an inexpensive machine), sometimes the screen would black out or freeze up -- this is when recording at 1280 x 720 dimensions.Â Additionally, editing the timeline on a PC was sometimes quirky. Objects would slide around, or shift other objects around. And everything was static.</p>
<p>With Camtasia for Mac, not only is the program better designed and architected, and feels more stable, it allows you to animate objects. The most interesting effect is the "Blank Effect." (I'm sure that, when naming this feature, someone just drew a blank.) The Blank Effect basically allows you to "tween" an object, to use Flash terms. Drag an arrow callout (for example) to your timeline, and then drag the blank effect on the beginning and end of the arrow. Put your cursor at a start point, then change the end point. Between the two points, Camtasia tweens or animates the object. I'm not explaining this well, and so I'll try to provide a video tutorial on this later.</p>
<p>To be fair, although I like Camtasia for Mac quite a bit, one project crashed on me in an irretrievable way. In a Camtasia for Mac project, never swap out, overwrite, or delete files that a project references on a timeline or media bin. If you do, the next time you save your project, you can't, and you have to throw out the whole project. Yep, so keep a backup every now and then. (This has only happened to me once.)</p>
<p>Overall, I feel that Camtasia for Mac was designed by a company that had spent years working on a PC version of the software. When they started the Mac version, it's as if they said, Let's take everything we learned and do this right.</p>
<p>For example, there's one key difference that stumped me at first. On the PC version, you can lock a track while making edits to the other tracks. (By the way, a bug related to multi-track editing often caused echoes to bleed from one track to another.) On the Mac version, you don't lock a track. You simply select a track and then split it apart where you want to edit it.</p>
<p>There are so many differences between the two programs, they almost feel like completely separate programs, rather than the same program for different platforms. But after recording a few videos, the workflow becomes second nature.</p>
<p>If you're thinking of switching to a Mac for video recording, here are two other incentives. If you ever plan to record video tutorials for mobile applications, you'll want a Mac so you can load Xcode environment and simulate the iPhone app. You'd think you could also do this on a PC, but no, you cannot. Nor can you record directly on your device (not easily, anyway).</p>
<p>Second, Macs are quieter internally. I have a Electrovoice RE-20 microphone hooked into a Health mixer to bring up the decibels. On my PC, even though it's a solid state drive, internally the machine is noisy as a factory. The background noise is troubling. You have to externalize your sound card to avoid circuitry white noise from contaminating your sound.</p>
<p>With the Mac, there's almost no background noise at all. This makes it much, much easier to edit. If you constantly struggle with static background noise, then every time you insert some blank space or mute a sound (such as a cough), your audio track sounds as if someone is cupping your ears to mute the world every so often.</p>
<p>Lavacon is approaching, and I'm presenting a session on audio with video tutorials, so you might see a few more posts on this topic in the coming days.</p>
