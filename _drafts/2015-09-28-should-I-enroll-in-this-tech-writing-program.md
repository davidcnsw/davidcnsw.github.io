Hey Tom, I am, I guess you could say, an aspiring technical writer. I've signed up for a tech comm cert from UCR this Fall/Winter/Spring. I googled some info on tech writing and a couple of your blog articles came up. They dealt with tech writing pay dipping and tech writing jobs being outsourced to India. The articles were several years old if I remember correctly. What is the picture now? I didn't see a more current blog posting on the subject. Is it a bad idea to get this cert? Are jobs and pay looking down?
