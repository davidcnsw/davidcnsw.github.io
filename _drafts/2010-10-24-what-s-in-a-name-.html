<p>larry raises a good point: </p>
<p>"All very true. Yet on Monday morning when I walk into the client meeting to talk about the new project, they're going to say “We need you to create some PDFs.” It's very hard to move managers away from that mindset.</p>
<p>It's hard, but we have to try. Do you think it will make any difference if we start referring to ourselves as content strategists rather than as technical writers or technical communicators? Put another way, if I refer to myself as a content strategist, will that Monday meeting go any differently? Instead of saying “We need some PDFs,” might they say “Tell us how we can make our content work more effectively”?</p>
<p>we changed our name, but nothing will happen.</p>
<p>there's so much controversy here. is it warranted?</p>
<p>is this this evolution something we naturally anticipate due to the explosion of tools, methods, languages, and processes? </p>
<p>If you look at the history of tech comm, this discussion about the term content strategy is exactly the same discussion that occurred when people started to promote the term “technical communicator.” Apparently the STC used to be called the Society of Technical Writers and Publishers, but they changed it in 1971 to the Society for Technical Communication to be more inclusive of the various types of media and techniques technical writers were using. (See this article for reference.)</p>
<p>From 1971 until today, as time has marched on, there have been more and more methods for communicating instructional material: screencasts, elearning, podcasts, interactive tutorials, online help, quick reference guides, dynamic help, context-sensitive help, and so on.</p>
<p>Additionally, the tools market has exploded. You're not just choosing between Robohelp or something else; you have at least 50 different tools and methods to choose from. DITA or wiki? Author-it or Flare? Sharepoint or something else? Online help or PDF? Collaborative tool or CMS? Screencasts, elearning, or flash embedded in PDF? Lots of choices and options.</p>
<p>The result? With more options, there's also more confusion and a greater need for strategy in the beginning. What tool? Why? Depends on the audience and purpose? There's a greater need to step back and ask the larger questions rather than just diving into tactics.</p>
<p>The way I see it, content strategy is a natural next step in the evolution of the profession, which started as technical writing. Writing is much more than we do. It then evolved to technical communication. But communication is more than we do. Now it has evolved to strategy. There are still many professionals stuck in phase 1, just writing manuals. There are many professionals engaged in phase 2, creating both manuals and elearning and perhaps illustrations. There are professionals engaged in phase 3, deciding on the right format and message for the audience, writers, and company.</p>
<p>It seems like just last Summit, Kathryn Burton was announcing that we finally changed the name from technical writer to technical communicator in the Bureau of Labor and Statistics Handbook. That new definition now seems inadequate to describe what we could/should/would do in our current roles. Here's that new definition:</p>
<p>“Develop and design instructional and informational tools needed to assure safe, appropriate, and effective use of science and technology, intellectual property, and manufactured products and services. Combine multimedia knowledge and strong communication skills with technical expertise to educate across the entire spectrum of users' abilities, technical experience, and visual and auditory capabilities.”</p>
<p>One could argue that with the terms “develop and design,” one is doing some planning and strategizing about the audience and purpose. But it's not called out in a direct way. Maybe it's not done much at all.</p>
<p>I'm curious to think about the next step after content strategy.</p>
<p>does telling people that you're a content strategist make any difference? is it any clearer to tell people that you're a content strategist than telling them you're a technical communicator? a technical writer? it's all the same to them. however, the writer one is particularly frustrating. Every time i mention that i'm a writer, I get pigeonholed as a writer and nothing more. no tools for illustration or AV.</p>
<p>perhaps by telling them that you're a content strategist, you can dash some of the stereotypes about what you should and should not do.</p>
<p>is this just talk among our own community? </p>
<p>what's leah guren's take on this? she was so </p>
