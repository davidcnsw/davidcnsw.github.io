<p>I have the opportunity to create documentation from scratch for a branch new project (two brand new projects, actually), and I'm remembering just how much I like writing documentation from scratch. I've been on too many projects where I inherited a set of documentation and then had to spend so much time "dealing" with it. By dealing with it, I mean all of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>wondering whether it's up to date, and if so, when it was last updated. Who reviewed it? Is that person still around? Have things changed since the content was written?</li>
<li>wondering how complete the information is, whether it is comprehensive or minimal, whether the steps are all accurate and complete.</li>
<li>once features are archived in past releases, it's assumed documentation is fine for them, so there is rarely space in the tech writer's schedule to go back and update the previous documentation. You have to fit in the updates "on your own time," so to speak. Most of the tech writer's doc efforts are focused on generating content for the next release.</li>
<li>does the style follow any particular guidelines, or is it just the writer's own preferences? does my style conflict with the writer's style, and if so how and where?</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the amount of legacy content you inherit for a project, these issues can be monumental. I once worked on a wiki that already had 1,000 pages when I started. As far as I could tell, 2/3 of it was old, but to go through and figure out what was old, what was new, and what was a mix of the two was more than I had time or energy to tackle.</p>
<p>With a new project, you don't have to deal with these issues. You don't have to play guessing games about the accuracy, relevance, and importance of the content. You can vouch for it.</p>
<p>This is all fine as you write the project, but what happens six months to a year from now when you're no longer working on the project? When you're either in another department or another company and a new technical writer takes your place, looks at the 100 pages of content you created, and has to go through this same guessing-game rigmarole all over again. It would be nice if one implemented some basic standards around documentation that involved leaving some metadata trails that included the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>who originally authored the content </li>
<li>who reviewed the content, and when</li>
<li>when was the content last updated</li>
<li>any notes about questionable areas or missing information. </li>
</ul>
<p>Presumable the prolog section of a DITA topic can include this metadata, as can any other sort of format you're working with.</p>
