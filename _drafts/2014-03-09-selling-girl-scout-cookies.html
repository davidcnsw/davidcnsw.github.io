<p>I helped Lucy and Callie sell girl scout cookies the other day. The first day, it was near the beginning of the season. Be put our booth in front of Safeway from 3-6pm on a Saturday and sold a ton (like 100+ boxes). A few people even challenged the girls with questions like, What makes you most proud about being a girl scout? Or What's your favorite kind of cookie? </p>
<p>The next </p>
