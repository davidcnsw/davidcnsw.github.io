<p>woody and gus are two scouts. woody is really mean, a bully, and he loves to pick on gus. woody makes fun of him a lot, and is always playing tricks on gus. one day they are out doing orienteering. woody ads a small magnet on gus's compass so that it throws gus off 15 degrees. gus ends up veering off course. he's gone for a long time. after a while, he realizes that woody has added a small magnet to his compass and he sees that he's way off course. but rather than come back, he decides to hang out in the woods. in fact, he navigates on his map and decides to go even further off course. he waits in the woods, even does some cooking and bird watching. </p>
<p>meanwhile, woody starts to feel bad about gus. he wonders if something maybe happened to gus. so he leaves camp and starts looking after him. he normally would have told others about it, but he didn't want to admit what he'd done, so he said he was going to get some water. people were busy setting up camp anyway and weren't paying too much attention. </p>
<p>woody wanders the path he thinks woody would have taken. gus hears him coming in the woods and decides to play a trick back on him. gus follows woody deeper and deeper into the woods. he pretends that he's really lost, so that woody will wander farther and farther. woody is shouting gus' name but gus doesn't return any of the calls. gus just silently snickers and thinks what a fool woody is. </p>
<p>woody leaves little red pieces of tape now and then on branches to mark his way. he ties the ribbon onto branches as he walks so that he can find his way back. gus leaves some distance between himself and woody, and he stars untying the ribbon and collecting them in his pocket. </p>
<p>after a while, gus gets tired of following woody, and he decides its time to end the game. he has punished woody enough, so gus lies down and pretends he has a broken ankle. he starts moaning. woody hears him a ways off and starts rushing toward him. gus can hardly keep from laughing, but he thinks of all the mean things woody has done to him, so he keeps a straight face. </p>
<p>as woody approaches him, panic starts in woody's heart as he sees that gus is hurt. it looks like gus has been here for a while, perhaps without water. woody starts to feel really bad. and then from behind the bush, about 20 yards before woody reaches gus, a small bear cub appears. </p>
<p>woody freezes. he knows that where there are cubs, there's a mamma grizzly. he tries to shoo the cub away, but it's too late, the mother grizzly already appears. she rears on her hind legs. she takes note of both gus and woody. she seems to be somewhat indecisive about just who she should go after. all of a sudden woody pulls some beef jerky out of his backpack, and he starts jumping up and down. he throws the jerky at the bear, who sniffs it and gets hungry for more. seeing he has the bear's attention, woody takes off running. both bears, mamma and the cub, chase after woody. in the distance, gus notices that woody manages to scramble up a tree, and the bear does its best to push the tree down. the bear pushes and pushes on the tree, and it wobbles this way and that, but the tree doesn't fall down. after some time, the bear loses interest and leaves. </p>
<p>when the bear is good and gone, gus walks over to woody. he sees that woody is really high up in the tree. he's scaled it to the highest possible branches, and he's a good 75 feet or higher in the tree. </p>
<p>woody looks down at gus and sees gus walking perfectly fine. in gus' pack he sees a lot of red ribbon as well, part of his trail. he knows gus has been playing him. woody tenses with anger. he decides to get some revenge. </p>
<p>woody doesn't move a muscle. he grabs a fat branch and holds it as tight as he can. he shouts down to gus, hey gus, help. i'm afraid of heights. i can't get down. he pretends to be completely scared. </p>
<p>gus remembers how woody got the bears to follow him, sacrificing himself for gus, and he starts climbing the tree. he's going to rescue woody. he shouts, Hang on, woody, I'm coming up there to get you. as he's climbing, he really doesn't have any more anger or resentment of woody. he climbs like a cat, scaling up branches left and right. as he gets near, woody, he sees that woody is smiling. he is just a few feet under woody, and woody kicks him right in the face with his boot and laughs.</p>
<p>gus falls down several branches but is caught by a larger branch. his nose is bleeding, and one of his teeth feels loose. he realizes woody has played him, just as he would do. so gus starts climbing quickly down. he moves down the tree fast, almost like he's falling from branch to branch. when he reaches the bottom, he grabs woody's backpack, which includes his compass and map, and he runs as fast as he can away from the tree, leaving woody all alone. </p>
<p>woody is trying to climb down the tree too, but he's not as fast as woody. he has to take the branches one at a time, and by the time he gets down to the bottom of the tree, woody is nowhere in sight. and it's getting dark. woody has no idea where home is. it looks like the same trees in every direction. woody starts to feel a chill run down his spine. he's lost, and he has no hope that gus is hanging out nearby now. now gus is clearly not going to help out. </p>
<p>woody starts walking. he's walking exactly the wrong way. he starts walking a bit faster, and soon he gets tangled in some stinging nettles. they sting his arms and legs with an itch that won't stop. then he tries crossing a creek on a fallen log, but he accidentally falls off the log and splashes into the water. now he's all wet. it's getting cold. woody tries to find shelter, but there really isn't any. his toes start to get cold, and colder. his wet clothes suck out all his body heat. he starts shaking. Gus? he calls. Gus? I need your help. For real this time. I really need ... your ... help. He doesn't hear anything. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Gus has made his way back to camp. Some others are starting to ask about Woody. Gus shrugs his shoulders and says he hasn't seen him. </p>
<p>Woody tries to pull some branches over him for warmth, but it doesn't work. he's shaking now and doesn't have any supplies. </p>
<p>back at the camp, some other kids notice that gus has woody's backpack. they know something's up and start questioning gus really hard. they give him the third degree. at first, gus says he has woody's backpack because he had made him carry it while he went out exploring, but the others don't believe his story. gus tries one lie after the other, but eventually he breaks down and tells the truth. the other boys are concerned. they remember their scout oath. they set out in the woods to look for woody. gus leads them as best he can remember to the spot where he left woody. </p>
<p>woody isn't there. they split up and decide to each take a compass bearing 5 degrees from each other in a circular pattern to find woody. within a few minutes, one of the boys finds woody. woody is lying still on his side, and he looks nearly dead. but he's not. the others come rushing over. they notice woody is wet and extremely cold. gus takes off his coat and clothes and puts them on woody while the others build a fire.</p>
<p>woody's skin starts to feel warmer, but he's slow to come to. meanwhile, gus starts to feel really cold. some other boys make a fire, and gus huddles near the fire. sparks fly out from the fire and keep landing on gus' skin, burning him in small little places.</p>
<p>eventually woody regains consciousness. he realizes he's wearing woody's clothes. he starts to feel bad. all of this back and forth -- it only seems to get each of them in a bad state. he takes off gus' coat and hands it back to him. i'm sorry, woody says. it's my fault for playing tricks on you. </p>
<p>no, gus says, accepting the coat. it's my fault for returning your tricks with my own. look where it's gotten us. i'm being continually burned by sparks from the fire, while you're so cold you're shaking in your boots. </p>
<p>woody extended his hand to gus to shake. let's be friends, woody said. yes, gus said, friends. and they said down next to each other by the campfire and just stared into the flames.</p>
