<p>Getting crisp images for mobile, tablet, and print can be a bit of a conundrum. I'm currently using Flare and Capture to handle screenshots, so here's my process.</p>
<p>I capture the screenshot using Capture. Because I'm capturing from a Kindle device, the screenshots are initially about 6in wide x 10in tall. On the Flare Print Format tab, I set the DPI to 250, and this shrinks the Print Size to 2.4 in x 4 in, which is perfect. I also set the image type as TIFF because TIFF is a lossless format, meaning it won't be blurry when resizing occurs. (The tradeoff is a large file size, but Flare addresses this quite well. On the Advanced tab of the online output, there's a check box that says "Generate 'web-safe' images" -- select that and those TIFFs will magically convert to PNGs when you generate an output.) That takes care of the print images.</p>
<p>For the mobile and tablet webhelp, I discovered something rather tricky with Flare. On the mobile webhelp target, on the Advanced tab, there's a check box that says "Generate resized copies of scaled images." Either there's a bug with this feature, or the quick help description is worded poorly. Presumably, one would think that shrinking the image using Flare's online topic editor would prompt Flare to regenerate the image at that smaller size on the output. However, all that really happens is that Flare inserts a height and width property for the image to adjust it's display in the browser. You still have the same file image size.</p>
<p>However, if you set a max-width property for images, then Flare does actually resize the image file to that size. For example, if your original 600px image were 140KB, and your max-width property for online images was set to 300px, the rendered file (which actually gets renamed too) might be half that size, about 70 KB.</p>
<p>At first I rejoiced to see this work, because I wanted my images to download quickly for mobile devices. However, setting a max-width property is problematic for several reasons. If you set a max-width of 300px, that may look great on an iPhone, but what about a tablet? It seems a bit small for a tablet device. And don't you want the image to fill the maximum frame available for the mobile device? Some of those Android smartphones have huge screens for mobile devices, so why not have a little larger image there compared with smaller devices?</p>
<p>Rather than trying to guess an ideal image dimension for mobile devices, I set the max-width property for images to display at 100%. This means the image will fill up 100% of the frame allowed. This works great with mobile, but now remember the tablet will show that mobile screenshot in its 600px glory. This screen size looks too large. So I wanted to set a max-width property of 400px for tablets, while leaving the max-width as 100% for mobile.</p>
<p>This is where CSS media queries. Such a media query looks something like this:</p>
<p>@media only screen and (max-width: 480px)<br />
img<br />
{<br />
max-width:100%;<br />
}</p>
<p>@media (min-width: 481px) {<br />
img {<br />
max-width:400px;<br />
}<br />
}</p>
<p>This means that for devices up to a maximum of 480px wide, set all images to fill 100% of the viewing frame. (I decided on 480px based on this <a href="http://nmsdvid.com/snippets/#">Media query values chart</a>.)</p>
<p>However, for devices that are 481px and larger, I don't want that screenshot to display at 600px. I'd rather have them show at about 400px -- a bit larger than the mobile display, but not the full 600px.</p>
<p>The only problem is that Flare strips out media queries. In an age where responsive styling is as important as ever, Madcap first scores big by offering a mobile output but then shoots itself in the foot by stripping out media queries. Yes, in your output, those beautiful media queries are just missing. Try as you might to reference them from somewhere else, either through an import command or a css link in your master page, they don't come through.</p>
<p>The only way to get around it (that I've found) is to manually edit the stylehseet in the generated output to include them. Drill into Advanced &gt; Resources &gt; Stylesheets and insert them at the end of the CSS file. The problem is, if you make a lot of updates and republish your help, making this edit each time will be tedious.</p>
