<p>Shannon has been gone for a week now with the girls at Girl Scout camp. It's times like these, when I'm alone, that I begin to see how my life would have played out had I not chosen the route of a family.</p>
<p>Here's what I would do. Very minimal housework -- only the bare minimum. Not much time at home. When at home, I spend the time in front of the computer or tv, or asleep in bed. I play basketball several nights a week. I go on bike rides. I stay later at work. I have no real friends. No driving purpose. My life is fairly empty and meaningless. My fridge is bare, stocked with food I only tolerate.</p>
<p>I'm 38 now. Today I watched a highlight video of our basketball team's most recent win. I was surprised to see myself play, surprised at how slow I moved, how much I stayed on the outside, how I was so much less talented than I thought. It made me realize that I'm getting old.</p>
<p>In other times in history, I might be dead by now. I've only got about 20 good years left in me. Now is the time when my children will begin to grow up, go to high school, and college, get married, have careers. They're so young now. They're full of energy and enthusiasm for life.</p>
<p>I feel like an old curmudgeon. If I keep in my ways, I'll realize one day that I've let so much slip by, that I've lived my life in a fairly meaningless way. My work means nothing to me. My blog means little to me. The many hours I toil away studying programming, and blogging, and playing basketball -- it all means so little.</p>
<p>Relationships are important. They bring meaning. I wish I had deeper relationships with those around me, but I'm always too busy for people. Even when people chat with me at work, after 5-10 minutes, I feel like I should end the conversation and return to work. I'm solitary. I'm a loner at heart.</p>
<p>What will I change about my life so that, in 20 years, I won't feel regret? I wish I had done more. I wish I hadn't spent so much of my time and energy playing basketball. I wish I had done more outings with my kids. I wish I had gone on more one-on-one dates with my kids. I wish I had spent more time listening to others and talking about life. I wish I had read more books. I wish I had spent more time outdoors. I wish I hadn't poured so much of my life energy into work. I wish I hadn't spent so much time blogging. I wish I had written more creatively. I wish I had made my wife happier. I wish I had developed deeper relationships with my kids. I wish I hadn't always been so selfish. I wish my life meant something more than the ephemeral blip on the stage of life.</p>
<p>If I could change my ways, what would they be?</p>
<p>1. Stop playing basketball. When you play ball with strangers, you feel lonely, empty. You come home with spent energy and are exhausted to do much of anything with your family. Quit your membership.</p>
<p>2. Listen more to others, really try to hear what they're saying.</p>
<p>3. Go on one-on-one dates with your daughters.</p>
<p>4. Do things that make your wife happy. Do things that make others around you happy.</p>
<p>When you die, those last moments on your bed will be about the meaningful relationships you've built. Enjoy other people. Make connections. Experience things together. Your family is beautiful. You are sad when you are alone.</p>
<p>5. Don't pour so much energy into work. Don't spend all your time trying to learn programming. Life is precious and short; it's not your passion. It's a job.</p>
<p>6. Try new things, explore new areas. You have fun doing this.</p>
<p>It sucks that there is no god, that the mind is a cruel trick plaid on you. Maybe there's something more, and maybe not.</p>
<p>Try to reify your goals even more:</p>
<p>1. Go on dates with your daughters -- once a week.</p>
<p>2. Give up basketball. Your old, slow, and it zaps your energy. You feel empty playing with strangers. Go on bike rides and walks instead.</p>
<p>3. Only study 3 pomodoros a day. Pace yourself. Enjoy life.</p>
<p>4. Clean up more around the house. Every day for 30 minutes.</p>
<p>5. Go on family outings every Saturday. Do something together.</p>
<p>6. Listen to people. Enjoy conversation.</p>
<p>7. Write more -- not on your tech writing blog, but on this blog.</p>
