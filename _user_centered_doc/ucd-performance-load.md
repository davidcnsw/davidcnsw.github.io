> The larger, more complex the system, the greater the strain on the user. The greater the strain, the lower the user's success. In many cases, documentation that is too massive deflates the user from even trying at all. Provide getting started tutorials and quick reference guides to reduce the performance load and encourage first steps in a system.

## Users resist long documentation

 ## When it becomes worth it

> "An information retrieval system will tend not to be used whenever it is more painful and troublesome for a customer to have information than for him not to have it." <br /><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mooers%27_law">Mooer's Law</a>

## Quick reference guides

Instead of eliminating potentially useful info, provide quick reference guides that help users get oriented quickly with minimal cognitive load and low cost.

## What are quick reference guides

* Differs from getting started, but both are welcome 
* Main tasks described in compressed, poetry-like form
* Like cliff notes or cheat sheet
* Shows shape of help content
* Especially helpful for lists of functions, classes, methods

## Quick reference guides example

## Strategy: Create "getting started" guides

<a href="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/getting-started/index.html"><img src="/user_centered_doc/media/rasters/vagrant.png"/></a>

** Outlines first steps in application
** This should be a required section in any guide

## Provide sequential tutorials

<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/getStarted/index.html"><img src="/user_centered_doc/media/rasters/java_beginners.png"/></a>

* For beginner wanting to learn, sequence is okay
* Beginners can't understand more complex topics initially
* Learning Java, you'd be lost if going into reference docs

## Give the big picture

<a href="http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/6.2.2/Admin/LearnhowtoadministerSplunk"><img src="/user_centered_doc/media/rasters/splunk.png"/></a>

* We get so focused on details, lose sight of big picture
* Narrative workflow topics address this scenario
* Step back. How and why does system work overall?
