> Users desire to be immersed in the application or system they're using. They don't want to leave that system to consult a separate, external system for help. As much as possible, bring help into the application to prolong the user's immersion in the application context.

## Users don't want to use help

> "The conclusion of most studies about how people use help is that people don't use help."<br/>-- Mike Hughes, <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2009/01/31/podcast-make-your-help-indispensable-safeguard-your-job/">I'd Rather Be Writing podcast</a>

## Bring help into the UI

<a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/mydoc_help_api.html"><img src="/user_centered_doc/media/rasters/tooltipdemo.png"/></a>

* Simple popovers or tooltips work well
* Provide UX designers with JSON file to act as content API 
* This is easiest way to do in-app help

## Fitt's Law

<blockquote>The further a user must travel with their cursor, the less accuracy the user will have in reaching the target object.<br/>&mdash; Travis Lowdermilk, <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028741.do"><i>User-centered Design</i></a></blockquote>

* If answer is far from problem area, less likely to find
* Proximity of info helps users find and use it
* Help doesn't need to be separate

## Much of the UI is text

* Look at all the text
* UX doesn't want to overload b/c text only helpful the first time
* Tech writers should play larger role in UI than they usually do 

## This is the same UI without text

* Useless without text
* The UI is domain where wordsmiths should reign
