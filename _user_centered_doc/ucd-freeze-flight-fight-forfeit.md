> Users feeling stress go through an emotional state where they first freeze, then potentially flee, or fight, and finally forfeit. Write documentation with the assumption that users will read it in a state of freeze/flight. This means readers will scan, jump around, and read quickly.

## Readers scan

> ** How Users Read on the Web**
> Summary: They don't. People rarely read Web pages word by word; instead, they scan the page, picking out individual words and sentences. <br />&mdash; Jakob Nielsen, <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-users-read-on-the-web/">Nielsen Norman Group</a>

## Use article summaries

## Use lots of subheadings<

## Make sentences short and easy

> We're thinking "great literature" (or at least "product brochure"), while the userâ€™s reality is much closer to "billboard going by at 60 miles an hour." &mdash; Steve Krug, <i>Don't Make Me Think</i>

## Structure information in lists
