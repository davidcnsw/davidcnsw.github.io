<div class="body">
<div class="p">When you're organizing your DITA files, it may be unclear about the right structure to use.
   Although you can use a variety of methods to organize your files, note the following
    limitations:
<ul class="ul" id="topic_kxb_3mz_bq__ul_v1y_pmz_bq">
<li class="li">The DITA Map file might have trouble loading topics in higher level folders. DITA Map files
     are like kings. They want all the other files to sit below them either in the same folder or in
     subfolders. Oxygen has a special parameter override you can set if you're referencing topics in
     higher folders than the map.</li>
<li class="li">References to a file will be more likely to break if you use subfolders. For example,
     suppose you put all your configuration topics into a folder called "configuration". References
     to a topic there will look like this: <span class="ph filepath">configuration/sample_config.dita</span>.
     Suppose you decide to move sample_config.dita into another folder. All your links will break.
     (To change folder paths, I believe you use the refactoring options, but honestly I haven't
     quite figured them out.)</li>
<li class="li">I do put images and glossary items in their own subfolders.</li>
<li class="li">I always name my ditamap docmap.ditamap. </li>
</ul>
