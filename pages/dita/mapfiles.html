{% include notes.html %}
<div class="body conbody">
<div class="p">The primary purpose of the map file is to arrange your table of contents. The map file looks
      like this:
{% highlight xml %}<map>
 <title>DITA Topic Map</title>
</map>{% endhighlight %}
</div>
<p class="p toc">
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Creating a TOC</h2>
<div class="p">You add references to the topics you want in the table of contents like
   this:
{% highlight xml %} <topicref href="keyref_links.dita"/>
 <topicref href="inline_links.dita"/>
 <topicref href="related_links.dita"/>
 <topicref href="relationship_tables.dita"/>{% endhighlight %}
</div>
<div class="p">To establish parent/child relationships between topics, nest the <code>topicref</code>
        elements in each other, like
        this:
{% highlight xml %} <topicref href="toc_links.dita">
 <topicref href="keyref_links.dita"/>
 <topicref href="inline_links.dita"/>
 <topicref href="related_links.dita"/>
 <topicref href="relationship_tables.dita"/>
</topicref>{% endhighlight %}
</div>
<p>Now the toc_inks.dita file (note the lack of the self-closed angle bracket "/>") will be the
        parent and the 4 links below it will be children. The parent topic will show the four child
        topics as embedded links along the <code>shortdesc</code> element from each child topic.
        Essentially the toc_links.dita file is blank and is filled with a preview of the other files
        nested below it. This is a general best practice for organizing the TOC.</p>
<p>Note that there is another element called a <code>topichead</code> that also allows you
        to group topics into hierarchical relationships, like this:</p>
<div class="p">
{% highlight xml %}<topichead navtitle="Links">
 <topicref href="keyref_links.dita"/>
 <topicref href="inline_links.dita"/>
 <topicref href="related_links.dita"/>
 <topicref href="relationship_tables.dita"/>
</topichead>{% endhighlight %}
</p></div>
<p>However, many people are opposed to using <code>topichead</code> because it creates a
        containing folder that does nothing except expand its folder contents when a user clicks it.
        There's a chance that users may think something isn't working, since clicking an option in
        the menu doesn't create any change in the main viewing window. </p>
<p>Regardless of the usability issue, it's a good idea to present a preview of the folder's
      contents on the parent topic anyway. This lets the user browse all the topics in the folder
      with one glance.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Combining topics</h2>
<div class="p">If you want to combine topics in each other, use the <code>chunk</code> attribute and
        specify whether each child topic should appear in the
        TOC:
{% highlight xml %} <topicref href="inserting_links.dita" chunk="to-content">
 <topicref href="inline_links.dita" toc="no"/>
 <topicref href="related_links.dita" toc="no"/>
 <topicref href="keyref_links.dita" toc="no"/>
</topicref>{% endhighlight %}
</div>
<p>This output will show Inserting Links as the topic title and the three child topics as
        subheadings within the topic. It will appear as one file. However, note that if you put
        inserting_links.dita into a relationship table, the related links will appear directly below
        the first topic rather than after keyref_links.dita. (Some Open Toolkit people want to
        decouple topics in the relationship table to allow for more granular relationships; however,
        I think this is a bug that should be fixed.)</p>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Folder structure</h2>
<p>All topics that the map file references need to be in either the same directory as the map or
        in a subdirectory to the map. Don't reference a topic outside of the map's directory (using
        ../ syntax). </p>
<p>I think it's easiest to leave all dita files loose in the root folder rather than
        organizing them into subfolders. Reason being, if you decide to reorganize your files, links
        to subfolder_a/sample.dita will break when you move sample.dita to subfolder_b.</p>
<p>To maintain some sense or order for loosely coupled files, you can begin the file name with
        the folder name. Alternatively, if you're on a Mac, you can use virtual folders by tagging
        the files with folder-like names.</p>
<p>For glossary entries, images, or other files clearly of a different format, using
        subfolders is probably a good idea.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Editing ditamap files</h2>
<p>You can more easily arrange the topics in your ditamap file using the DITA Maps Manager
        feature in Oxygen. This is the panel that appears on the left of the main window.
        Right-click your ditamap file tab and select <strong class="ph b">Open in DITA Maps Manager</strong>.</p>
<p>Through the DITA Maps Manager, you can easily see if a topic is invalid, as it will include a
        red exclamation mark next to it. Parent-child hierarchies are also formatted with
        expand/collapse displays. You can see profiling conditions, edit properties, set
        parent-child hierarchies, and do other things through the Maps Manager.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Applying attributes to groups of elements</h2>
<div class="p">Suppose you want to group a set of topics in your map so that all topics in the group inherit
        the same attributes and properties. By making the topics children of an element, the
        children inherit the parent's properties.</p>
{% highlight xml %} <topichead audience="field_engineers" navtitle="Resources">
  <topicref href="concept.dita"/>
  <topicref href="notes.dita"/>
  <topicref href="conref.dita"/>
 </topicgroup>{% endhighlight %}
</div>
<p>Now concept.dita, notes.dita, and conref.dita will all have the attribute
          <code>audience="field_engineers"</code>. These topics will appear inside a folder
        called Resources.</p>
<div class="p">You can also use the <code>topicgroup</code> element to do the same bulk-applying of
        attributes. The difference between <code>topichead</code> and
          <code>topicgroup</code> is that <code>topichead</code> applies a hierarchy in the
        TOC, while <code>topicgroup</code> does not result in any
        hierarchy.
{% highlight xml %} <topicref href="toc_links.dita" audience="field_engineers">
  <topicref href="concept.dita"/>
  <topicref href="notes.dita"/>
  <topicref href="conref.dita"/>
 </topicref>{% endhighlight %}
</div>
<p>In this example, all the topics in this group will have the
          <code>audience="field_engineers"</code> attribute applied to them. If you want to
        apply a grouping independent of any hierarchy, use the <code>topicgroup</code>
        element.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Linking to non-TOC files</h2>
<p>You probably want to link a couple of other files from your ditamap: your notes file (where
        you store all your conrefs), your relationship table, and your glossary. You could combine
        them all in the same map, but doing so will make the ditamap file long. When you add these
        non-TOC links, add an attribute of <code>processing-role:"resource only".</code></p>
{% highlight xml %}  <topicref processing-role="resource-only" href="notes.dita" />
  <mapref processing-role="resource-only" href="keys.ditamap"/>
  <mapref processing-role="resource-only" href="relationship_table.ditamap"/> {% endhighlight %}
<p>Notice that I used <code>mapref</code> here instead of <code>topicref</code>. If
        you use <code>topicref</code> and point to a ditamap file, add
          <code>format="ditamap"</code> in your attributes.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you're linking to a ditamap, use <code>mapref</code> instead of
          <code>topicref</code>. If you do use <code>topicref</code>, you must remember to
        add the <code>format="ditamap"</code> attribute. </p>
