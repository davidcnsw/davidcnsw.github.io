{{tip}}See also <a class="xref" href="/md2html2ditav2" title="Markdown drastically simplifies the authoring process. As long as you don't need to incorporate conref and other DITA specific tags (which aren't available in Markdown), you can implement this super simple authoring process.">DITA: Author in Markdown, publish with DITA</a> for another way of converting HTML to DITA.{{end}}
<p>Converting content to DITA isn't a small undertaking, because you'll essentially have to retag
                everything with the DITA markup. There are some automated ways of converting
                content, but if your source content isn't already in a DITA friendly format, for
                example, if you have lots of topics that combine lists and concepts, or that have
                nested subsections (third-level headers), the conversion might require some
                restructuring. Nevertheless, you can speed up the process using a combination of
                HTML Tidy and Oxygen's XHTML to DITA transform.</p>
{{note}}If you have large conversion projects, this method probably isn't suitable.
                If you have thousands of topics to convert, for example, take a look at Stilo or
                some other automated process. You may need to write custom scripts that tag content
                based on your structure. If, on the other hand, you have less than 100 pages to
                convert, the method described here might be just fine.{{end}}

<div class="itemgroup info">
<p>There are a variety of settings on the HTML Tidy page. You can just use the defaults. Paste your

                            You might not want to bring this over. Just insert the body content.
                            Tidy will supply the necessary HTML head tags to make the page valid. </p>

<div class="itemgroup info">The transform will look for the first h1 tag and insert this as the

                        will get rendered as the document title. That heading level will then
                        actually be removed! Therefore, it's important not to forget to add the h1
                        tag to your content before running the transform.
{{note}}If you're converting
                            a page with a lot of code, the transform may not recognize the code
                            samples unless they're wrapped in <code>pre</code> tags. If the
                            transform can't recognize the code, it may eliminate the code
                            section.{{end}}

<p>When you look at the source of the newly converted DITA topics, you'll see that many of them have sections that have comments in them, such as this:</p>

      <span class="ph aui-icon icon-warning">Icon</span>
                    {% endhighlight %}
<p>In this case, the original source used this class for notes. The
                            transform doesn't know how to map classes to note elements, so you'll
                            have to manually tag these sections as notes.</p>
<p>DITA will convert classes to an <code>outputclass</code> element.
                            (The <code>outputclass</code> element converts back to a
                                <code>class</code> element when you transform your DITA content
                            into HTML.) However, most likely the class tags on your previous
                            platform won't have the same meaning as your new platform.</p>

<h2 class="title topictitle2">Find opportunities for re-use (DITA)</h2>
<div class="body taskbody">
<div class="section context">
<p>One of the reasons for converting to DITA is to harness the content re-use
                    capabilities. Now you should extract redundant content into separate files for
                    re-use. This is the tricky part. If you migrated content out of Confluence, and
                    you were using multiexerpt include macros to single source content into multiple
                    files, you'll want to assess the content and figure out how you want to single
                    source the material. </p>
<div class="p">You have a couple of options for re-using content:
<ul class="ul" id="convert3__ul_hmv_3kf_4p">
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Conref. </strong>You could create a generic file to store common content,
                            and then use conref tags where you want to insert this content. See
                                <a class="xref" href="/conref" title="You can re-use notes and other content through an attribute called conref.">Conref (re-use of content)</a> for more details. Using conref makes
                            sense especially for notes and other small chunks that are re-used
                            across many different files.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Conditionalization. </strong>You could conditionalize the content so that
                            you have attributes corresponding to different outputs on parts of the
                            page. See <a class="xref" href="/conditional_profiling" title="You can add attributes to elements and then filter your transforms to include any element that has attributes with certain values.">DITA: Conditional profiling</a> for more details.
                            Conditional profiling makes sense when you have a few variations of the
                            same topic for different audiences.</li>
