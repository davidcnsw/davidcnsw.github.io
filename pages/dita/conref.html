{% include notes.html %}
<div class="body conbody">
<p>First, create a page where you'll store all of these notes and re-usable components. Then use the
 <code>conref</code> tag on the elements you want to pull in the re-usable content.
 </p>
<p>Suppose the file where you store the re-usable component is called notes.dita with a topic id of
   "topic_123". On this page, you might have something like this: </p>
{% highlight xml %}
  <topic id="topic_123">
   ...
  <note type="note" id="bolt_warning">Don't overtighten the bolts, as it may cause stripping.</note>
 {% endhighlight %}
<p>On the page where you want to re-use the content, use the <code>conref</code> element like this:</p>
{% highlight xml %}
  <note conref="notes.dita#topic_123/bolt_warning"/>
 {% endhighlight %}
<p>In other words, use the file name#topic_id/element_id. </p>
{{note}}Make sure the <code>conref</code> pulls in a valid element where you're using the
   conref. This is the one rule with conrefs. You have to match the elements that you're conref'ing.
   You can't pull an element into your content from somewhere else if that element isn't valid
   there. For example, you couldn't pull a <code>section</code> into a <code>steps</code>
   element. This is why it's very common to use <code>ph</code> tags when setting up conrefs.
    <code>ph</code> tags can be inserted practically anywhere.{{end}}
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Conref of table content</h2>
<div class="p">If you're "conrefing" a table element, you have to include all of the table elements, like
   this:
{% highlight xml %}   <table conref="notesdita#topic_123/samptable">
    <tgroup cols="2">
     <tbody>
      <row>
       <entry/>
      </row>
     </tbody>
    </tgroup>
   </table>{% endhighlight %}
</div>
<p>In this case,  the ID of the table I'm re-using is <code>samptable</code>. </p>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Conref ranges: Including ranges of sibling content</h2>
<p>Sometimes you need to insert a range of elements. For example, suppose you have several paragrahps or list items. Rather than using multiple conrefs, you can instead use a range. The conref range will grab all items that are siblings. </p>
<p>To insert a range, you need to add an item to the first item and the last item. Here's an example:</p>
{% highlight xml %}<glossdef><p id="ot_first">The open toolkit is what processes your DITA files to transform them into webhelp, pdf, and other outputs.</p>
        <p>There are other processors besides the OT that can achieve similar results.</p>
        <p id="ot_last">OxygenXML does use the Open Toolkit to do its processing, but xMetaL uses another processor.</p>
    </glossdef>  {% endhighlight %}
<p>And here's the page where you insert the range. This is a table <code>entry</code> element:</p>
{% highlight xml %}<entry><p conref="glossary/ot.dita#opentoolkit/ot_first" conrefend="glossary/ot.dita#opentoolkit/ot_last"/></entry> {% endhighlight %}
<p>You just start the <code>conref</code> and add a <code>conrefend</code> element that
    refers to the last item in the conref range that you want to pull over.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Conkeyref: Conrefs using keyrefs</h2>
<p>conkeyref is similar to conref except that instead of referring to files, you refer to keys
    to include the target content. </p>
<p>example: </p>
{% highlight xml %}<keyref keys="argument" href="argument_acme.dita">{% endhighlight %}
<p>There's a paragraph in this topic with an ID of <code>opener</code> that I want to
    re-use. </p>
<p>I could reuse the paragraph with a conref like this:</p>
{% highlight xml %}<p conref="argument_acme.dita#topicid/opener"/>{% endhighlight %}
<p>However, sometimes when you have multiple outputs, you may want opener to pull from
    different files depending on the output. For example, you may have an opener for product A
    that differs from product B. Product A's map may point its argument key to
    argument_acme.dita, while Product B may point its argument key to argument_beta.dita. </p>
<div class="p">To implement the conref using keys, you use conkeyref, like
    this:
{% highlight xml %}<p conkeyref="argument/opener"/>{% endhighlight %}
</div></div>
</p></div>
