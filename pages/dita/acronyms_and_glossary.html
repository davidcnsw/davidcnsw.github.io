</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Create a glossary topic</h2>
<div class="p">First, create a new <code>glossterm</code> topic type. Only the <code>glossterm</code>
                and the <code>glossdef</code> are required elements in a glossary topic.
                However, if you want to have a full name and an acronym for the glossary term, you
                must add some more elements after the <code>glossdef</code>. Add a
                    <code>glossBody</code> tag and define the <code>glossSurfaceForm</code>
                and the <code>glossAcronym</code> as shown in the following
                example:
{% highlight xml %}<glossentry id="opentoolkit">
    <glossterm>Open Toolkit</glossterm>
    <glossdef><p>The open toolkit is what processes your DITA files to transform them into webhelp,
                 pdf, and other outputs.</p>
              <p>There are other processors besides the OT that can achieve similar results.</p>
              <p>OxygenXML does use the Open Toolkit to do its processing, but Trisoft uses another processor.</p>
</glossdef>
<!-- the rest of this content is optional-->
    <glossBody>
        <glossSurfaceForm>Open Toolkit (OT)</glossSurfaceForm>
        <glossAlt>
            <glossAcronym>OT</glossAcronym>
        </glossAlt>
    </glossBody>
</glossentry>{% endhighlight %}
</div>
<p>The <code>glossSurfaceForm</code> is the form of the term the first time it "surfaces" on
                the page. The <code>glossAcronym</code> is the form that appears on subsequent
                references. Both forms link back to the glossary definition.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Reference your glossary term on your map</h2>
<div class="p">To include the glossary term in your output, in your map file, add
                this:
{% highlight xml %}<glossref keys="opentoolkit" href="ot.dita" />{% endhighlight %}
</div>
<p>In DITA, a resource must be referenced on your DITA map to be included in the output.
                Here we're using the key <code>opentoolkit</code> to refer to this glossary term
                reference. The nice thing about keys is that you can change what the key refers to
                without breaking all your links (keys function like variables). The key
                    <code>opentoolkit</code> will look at the content in the ot.dita file and
                pull in the glossary term name automatically to render as the name of the link.</p>
<p>For example, suppose I've been referring to the key <code>opentoolkit</code>
                through my documentation. The glossary term name is "Open Toolkit." Then I decide
                that I really want to refer to it as "DITA Open Toolkit." I won't need to change any
                of my documentation references, because they're all using
                    <code>opentoolkit</code> to refer to the glossary term. I just change the
                glossary term title that the <code>opentoolkit</code> key points to (or the
                    <code>glossSurfaceForm</code> or <code>glossAcronym</code>). Then all
                the references will be updated. </p>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Reference the glossary term in a topic</h2>
<p>You can refer to the glossary term a couple of different ways in topics:
                    <code>abbreviated-form</code> or <code>term</code>.</p>
<div class="p">Here's an example using the <code>abbreviated-form</code>
                element:
{% highlight xml %}The <abbreviated-form keyref="opentoolkit"/> is what processes your DITA files.
Make sure you have the latest version of the <abbreviated-form keyref="opentoolkit"/>.{% endhighlight %}
</div>
<p>The output will look like this:</p>
<div class="p demo">
{% highlight xml %}The <strong class="ph b">Open Toolkit (OT)</strong> is what processes your DITA files. Make sure
      you have the latest version of the <strong class="ph b">OT</strong>.{% endhighlight %}
</p></div>
<div class="p">
{{note}} For this demo, rather than hyperlinks to the glossary or acronym term, I've
                    just formatted the words in bold. In the Oxygen webhelp file, they would be
                    links to the topics. See the <a class="xref external" href="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/files/oxygendemos/glossary/#glossary_demo_source.html" target="_blank">source code topic in the demo.</a>{{end}}
</p></div>
<p>Notice how the <code>abbreviated-form</code> element intelligently displayed
                    the <code>glossSurfaceForm</code> on the first reference, and the
                        <code>glossAcronymForm</code> on subsequent references? If you have
                    acronyms and you want this functionality, make sure to use the
                        <code>abbreviated-form</code> when referring to the glossary term.</p>
<p>If the glossary term doesn't have an acronym form, you could also just reference
                    it using <code>term</code>, like this: </p>
{% highlight xml %}The <term keyref="opentoolkit"/> is what processes your DITA files.
Make sure you have the latest version of the <term keyref="opentoolkit"/>.{% endhighlight %}
<p>The output will look like this:</p>
<div class="p">
{% highlight xml %}The <strong class="ph b">OT</strong> is what processes your DITA files. Make sure
      you have the latest version of the <strong class="ph b">OT</strong>.{% endhighlight %}
</p></div>
<p>In both instances of the word, the <code>glossAcronymForm</code> is used. If the
                glossary file didn't have a <code>glossAcronymForm</code>, the
                    <code>title</code> would be used instead.</p>
<p>(By the way, you don't have to use either abbreviated-form or term to refer to a
                glossary term. You could also just refer to it with an <code>xref</code>.
                However, if you just use <code>xref</code>, no tooltip appears when you mouse
                over the link. Hence this method isn't recommended.) </p>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">A note about style</h2>
<div class="p">Note that the content in <code>glossBody</code> will appear in the webhelp output
                unless you add some styling that hides it. Create the following CSS styles and add
                it to your <a class="xref" href="/webhelp_skins" title="Oxygen offers a robust webhelp skin builder that allows you to customize the output. You can also customize the CSS.">DITA: Webhelp skins</a> CSS to hide this
                content:
{% highlight xml %}.glossSurfaceForm, .glossAlt {
    display: none;
}{% endhighlight %}
</div></div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Organizing glossary
         files</h2>
<p>Where should glossary terms be organized -- in your root folder with
             other topics, or in a subfolder? Personally, I like to keep my glossary files
             organized in a subdirectory called "glossary." However, you can organize them
             however you want. </p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Displaying your glossary in the TOC</h2>
<p>As with other resources, you have to include your glossary files on your DITA map if you
                want them to appear in your output. (If you have a lot of glossary terms, you can
                put them in a separate DITA map and then reference that DITA map on your root DITA
                map using <code>mapref</code>. ) Your glossary terms are just links to your
                glossary files. Here's how I do it. </p>
<p>It can look odd to dedicate an entire page to a term that if the term is only a
                couple of sentences long, so I consolidate all of my glossary terms so they appear
                in the same TOC entry. For a demo, look at the <a class="xref" href="/glossary_overview#topic_kjk_1kn_hq">Demo Glossary Overview</a> in the TOC.</p>
<p>To consolidate glossary terms on a single page in the output, use the
                    <code>chunk="to-content"</code> attribute in your glossary overview topic,
                like this:</p>
{% highlight xml %}<topicref href="glossary_overview.dita" chunk="to-content">
   <topicref href="glossary/ot.dita" toc="yes"/>
   <topicref href="glossary/conref.dita" toc="yes"/>
</topicref> {% endhighlight %}
{{note}}See the <a class="xref external" href="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/files/oxygendemos/glossary/index.html" target="_blank">demo</a> for an example of the glossary integrated into the TOC.{{end}}
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<p>This <code>chunk="to-content"</code> attribute will merge the children into
                itself.</p>
<div class="p">You might think that you can just use <code>glossref</code>
                elements with chunk="to-content", like
                this:
{% highlight xml %}<topicref href="glossary_overview.dita" chunk="to-content">
   <glossref href="glossary/ot.dita" keys="opentoolkit" toc="yes"/>
   <glossref href="glossary/conref.dita" keys="conref" toc="yes"/>
</topicref> {% endhighlight %}
</div>
<p>However,
                if you use this method, the key references will no longer work. The
                    <code>chunk</code> attribute screws them up. In places where the glossary
                term should appear, you'll just see blank spaces. As a workaround, when using the
                    <code>chunk</code> attribute, you must separate out the
                    <code>topicref</code> from the <code>keyref</code> elements, like this:
            </p>
{% highlight xml %}<topicref href="glossary_overview.dita" chunk="to-content">
  <topicref href="glossary/ot.dita" toc="yes"/>
  <topicref href="glossary/conref.dita" toc="yes"/>
</topicref>

<!-- glossary keys -->
<glossref keys="opentoolkit" href="ot.dita"/>
<glossref keys="conref" href="conref.dita"/>
             {% endhighlight %}
<p>(I'm
            not sure if this is a bug in Oxygen or the OT or what. At any rate, that's is how you do
            it.)</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Reusing glossary definitions</h2>
<p>A common scenario with re-use is to
                re-use definitions of your glossary terms in other parts of your documentation. For
                example, suppose you want to reuse the Open Toolkit definition in the glossary term
                topic above. Suppose you have a topic listing a table with field
                definitions:</p>
{% highlight xml %}            <topic id="topic_table">
              <title>Sample table of definitions</title>
              <body>
                <table>
                  <tgroup cols="2">
                    <thead>
                      <row>
                        <entry>Fields</entry>
                        <entry>Definitions</entry>
                      </row>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                      <row>
                        <entry><abbreviated-form
                keyref="opentoolkit"/></entry>
                        <entry><strong class="ph b">[glossary
                definition]</strong></entry>
                      </row>
                    </tbody>
                  </tgroup>
                </table>
                <p>Besure to check out <topicsetref id="hey"/></p>
              </body>
            </topic>
     {% endhighlight %}
<p>You
                can't use <code>conref</code> to re-use the <code>glossdef</code> element
                into the table's <code>entry</code> element because the <code>entry</code>
                element doesn't allow <code>glossdef</code> elements.</p>
<p>The way to do this
                is by wrapping the <code>glossdef</code> content inside a <code>ph</code>
                element (phrase element), and then embed the <code>ph</code> element into the
                table row. Here I wrap the <code>glossdef</code> content inside a
                    <code>ph</code>
                element:</p>
{% highlight xml %}<glossdef><ph id="ot_def">The open toolkit is what processes your DITA files to transform them into
webhelp, pdf, and other outputs.</ph></glossdef>{% endhighlight %}
<p>Then
                you use <code>conref</code> to insert the <code>ph</code> element into your
                table element, like this:</p>
<div class="p">
{% highlight xml %}<entry><ph conref="filename.dita#opentoolkit/ot_def"/>{% endhighlight %}
</p></div>
<p>Here's a sample result pulling the glossary definitions into another topic: <a class="xref" href="/sample_table_def">Sample table of definitions</a>. </p>
<p>The table code simply looks like this:
            </p>
{% highlight xml %}   <table>
      <tgroup cols="2">
        <thead>
          <row>
            <entry>Fields</entry>
          <entry>Definitions</entry>
          </row>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <row>
            <entry><term keyref="conref"/></entry>
            <entry><p conref="glossary/conref.dita#conref"/>
            </entry>
          </row>
          <row>
            <entry><term keyref="opentoolkit"/></entry>
            <entry><ph conref="filename.dita#opentoolkit/ot_def"/>
          </row>
        </tbody>
      </tgroup>
    </table>{% endhighlight %}
<p>This technique works well for short glossary definitions, but what if you have a definition that spans several paragraphs? Do you have to create three separate conref elements?</p>
<p>To include multiple sibling elements (such as three paragraph tags in a row), you can
                use what's called a "conref range." First you add an ID tag to the first and last
                element that you want to bring over. If my glossary definition has three paragraphs,
                I could tag it like this:</p>
<div class="p">
{% highlight xml %}<glossdef>
  <p id="ot_first">The open toolkit is what processes your DITA files to transform them
    into webhelp, pdf, and other outputs.</p>
  <p>There are other processors besides the OT that can achieve similar results.</p>
  <p id="ot_last">OxygenXML does use the Open Toolkit to do its processing, but
      Trisoft uses another processor.</p>
    </glossdef>{% endhighlight %}
<p>                Notice how I added an ID attribute to the first and last paragraph tags.</p></div>
<div class="p">Now I use a <code>conref</code> range to bring over the first and last element
                and everything in
                between:
{% highlight xml %}<p conref="glossary/ot.dita#opentoolkit/ot_first"
conrefend="glossary/ot.dita#opentoolkit/ot_last"/>{% endhighlight %}
<p>Note
                that although you can use this technique to bring over longer amounts of content,
                generally you want to keep your glossary definitions to a paragraph level size. If
                you use multiple paragraphs, the paragraphs will make the tooltip for the glossary
                link big and ugly.</p></div>
<p>Also note that if you reuse a glossary definition in another topic, your topic now requires the
                glossary definition to be present in the output for the topic to be valid. If you
                have scenarios where you don't want your outputs to include the glossary definition,
                then don't set up this dependency. Instead, pull the conref from another file that
                serves as a general "warehouse" of re-usable components.</p>
</div></div>
