<div class="p">
{% highlight xml %}<note type="tip">Don't fasten the bolts too tightly. First make sure all the pieces
fit well together, and then tighten them down firmly.</note>{% endhighlight %}
</p></div>
<p>There are actually quite a few options for note types: attention, danger, fastpath, important, notice, other, remember, restriction, tip, warning.</p>
<p>Some of the types have different icons and formatting associated with them. All of notes
   transform to HTML with a class corresponding with their name. </p>
<p>If you're adding a note inside a task list, add the note inside the <code>info</code>
   element.</p>
<div class="p">If you want a title to preface the note, use the <code>fig</code>
   element:
{% highlight xml %}<fig><title>Bolt Warning</title>
<note type="tip">Don't fasten the bolts too tightly.
First make sure all the pieces fit well together, and then tighten them down firmly.</note>
</fig>{% endhighlight %}
</div></div>
