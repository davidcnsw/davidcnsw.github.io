description: "If you want to create rules that enforce a specific structure to your content, you can
use one of the existing DITA specializations (concept, task, reference) or create your own
specializations. However, I don't recommend using DITA's specializations unless your writers
need it."

<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Rethinking specializations</h2>
<p>When I first started authoring in DITA, I thought the specializations were DITA requirements,
        or at least best practices. I ended up trying to make my content fit into concept and task
        topic types, often implementing complicated nesting, overloading certain elements with
        unintended info, and going out of my way to implement other workarounds to accommodate these
        topic types.</p>
<p>At some point, I realized that these specializations didn't really fit my information model. In fact, I don't think pouring content into task or concept models is a particularly good approach to creating content. Writers end up fragmenting their content into these different information types, dividing content that should be together into a million tiny little topics.</p>
<p>I instead prefer to use the base topic type rather than these specializations. Instead of using cookie cutter shapes to try to make information fit into, I think it's better to analyze the goal and construct the information users need appropriately. You can still emphasize a task-based approach without enforcing a structure that makes it cumbersome to add more than one list or an extended explanation at the beginning.</p>
<p>Additionally, using the base topic type is much easier to work with if you're leveraging any jQuery plugins. It also simplifies DITA authoring considerably, and results in a better output. Also, there is no research ever done to support DITA's specialized information types as being any more instructive than a general task-based approach. </p>
<p>So, save yourself some time. Skip the specializations and just write content with an action-oriented approach. Your DITA experience will be much less frustrating, and rather than trying to sort out the logic that restricts certain elements and their orders, trying to force-fit it to work with your content, you can instead focus on creating user-friendly content.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Concept topic types</h2>
<p>Concepts are topic types for any information that doesn't involve task lists or reference
      information. Ideally you use <code>concept</code> elements to explain concepts, ideas,
      overviews, workflows, and the like.</p>
<p>The basic structure of a concept topic looks like this:</p>
<div class="p">
{% highlight xml %}- title
- shortdesc
- conbody
    - p (optional)
    - section
        - title
    - p
    - image
    - codeblock
    - etc.{% endhighlight %}
</p></div>
<p>Here's an actual sample:</p>
{% highlight xml %}<title>Keeping a clean house</title>
<shortdesc>Cleaning your house helps make your home comfortable and pleasant.
There are lots of strategies to consider when trying to maintain a clean home.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <section><title>A place for everything</title>
  <p>The organizing principle of a clean home is to establish a place for everything.
Without a place, you cannot establish order in your house.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section><title>Everything in its place</title>
  <p>You must also define a strategy for putting everything its proper place.</p>
  </section>
 </conbody>{% endhighlight %}
<p>With concepts, each subsection is a <code>section</code> element. You can't nest
        <code>section</code> elements with each other, but you can nest
        <code>concept</code> elements inside each other. If you really need a third
        level, and you don't want to nest <code>concept</code> elements, you can add a
        paragraph with an <code>outputclass</code> that looks like a third level heading.
        (See <a class="xref" href="/combining_topics" title="You can combine topics into longer articles using the chunk attribute on your map. This issue usually crops up if you're using the specialized topic types (task, concept) and you're trying to combine information.">DITA: Combining topics</a>.)</p>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Task topic types</h2>
<p>Task topic types have robust options for including information, results, and other
        details with each of the steps.</p>
<p> Here's the element structure of the task. This outline shows what tags are allowed at each
          level.</p>

<p>As you're working in Oxygen, if you're in the Text view, type < and wait for the prompt to
          show you the available tags at that level. You can use your arrow keys to move up and down to see
          descriptions of each of the elements.</p>
<p>Most of the tags are self-explanatory, but a few are worth explaining. The <code>cmd</code>
          element is where the heart of the instruction lives -- it's the action verb for the
          instruction. The <code>cmd</code> element is a single block level element and
          doesn't allow many other elements inside it (but does allow <code>image</code>,
          <code>codeph</code>, <code>menucascade</code>, <code>uicontrol</code>,
          and other elements. </p>
<p>Any time you need to elaborate more with additional information, notes, code samples, or other
          details, add this additional information inside an <code>info</code> element after
          the <code>cmd</code> element. You can add many elements inside the
          <code>info</code> element, such as <code>p</code>, <code>image</code>,
          <code>codeblock</code>, and more.</p>
<p>If you use the <code>importance="optional"</code> attribute on a <code>step</code>
          element, the output will show (Optional) before the step.</p>
<p>If you have multiple options for a step, use the <code>choices</code> element.</p>

<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Reference</h2>
<p>The reference topic type is for storing reference information, such as extensive
        tables, lists, or other information that is used as support for a task. Reference topics are
        also designed for API information.</p>
<p>There are some tags specific to reference topics that aren't available elsewhere, such as a
          <code>refsyn</code> and properties table. The following examples come from the <a class="xref external" href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/v1.2/os/spec/archSpec/dita_reference_topic.html#dita_ref_topic" target="_blank">1.2 DITA spec on the reference topic type</a>.</p>
<div class="p">Here's an example of how to use the <code>refsyn</code>
          element:
{% highlight xml %}<refsyn>

          <propvaluehd>Oil brand</propvaluehd>

</div>
<p>I don't use reference topics very much, but it may be that my content doesn't seem to call for
          it. I don't quite get what the properties table provides that a regular table doesn't provide.
          The only difference seems that you can generate a table with different styles for the
          different columns, and therefore customize its appearance to look different from that of other
          tables.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Glossary topic types</h2>
<p>Creating a glossary involves creating <code>glossentry</code> topics, referencing
        the <code>glossentry</code> topics via keys, and compiling a glossary of terms in a DITA
        map.</p>
<div class="p">First create each glossary entry topic using the <code>glossentry</code> topic type. The
          glossentry topic requires just two elements:</p>
{% highlight xml %}<glossterm>OT</glossterm>
<glossdef>Open Toolkit -- This is what processes DITA into the various outputs.</glossdef>{% endhighlight %}
</div>
<p>There are additional elements available in the <code>glossBody</code> tag if needed.</p>
<div class="p">Next, create a ditamap file that will contain all of your glossary entry topics. You could put
          this in your main ditamap, but it's easier to manage it if the glossary map is separated into its
          own file. Add keys for each of the terms. The keys are like short references for the glossary
          reference.
{% highlight xml %}<map>
 <title>Glossary</title>
 
 <glossref href="ot.dita" keys="opentoolkit" />
 <glossref href="ide.dita" keys="ide"/>

</map>{% endhighlight %}
</div>
<div class="p">In your main map file, reference your glossary ditamap. In this example, my ditamap containing
          all the glossary entries is called
          glossary_entries.ditamap:
{% highlight xml %} <mapref href="glossary_entries.ditamap" processing-role="resource-only"/>{% endhighlight %}
</div>
<div class="p">In regular topics where you want to link to the glossary entry, refer to the glossary entry
          like this:</p>
{% highlight xml %}  <p>You can use the <term keyref="opentoolkit">Open Toolkit</term> to process your dita files.</p>{% endhighlight %}
</div>
<p>The term will have a link to the glossary entry topic and also show a tooltip with the glossary
          definition.</p>
<p>To compile a list of glossary terms in your main table of contents, add references to the
          glossary entry topics just like any normal topic references: </p>
<div class="p">
{% highlight xml %} <topichead navtitle="Glossary" chunk="to-content">
  <topicref href="ot.dita"/>
  <topicref href="ide.dita"/>
 </topichead>{% endhighlight %}
</p></div>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Topic size limitations</h2>
<p>Topics should be substantial enough to help a users complete his or her goal. However, there
        are a few topic size limitations with DITA that might seem to limit your ability to put all the information you need in a topic.</p>
<p><strong class="ph b">Task limitations</strong>. For task types, you can have only one task list per <code>task</code> element. If you have
          multiple task lists, you have the following options:</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">Split the tasks into separate files. If warranted, combine the tasks through your map
              file. If the tasks are each pretty meaty, leave them as separate files.</li>
<li class="li">Nest <code>task</code> elements inside of each other. This might be useful if you
              have a process that involves multiple subtasks and each of the subtasks are short. See
              <a class="xref" href="/combining_topics" title="You can combine topics into longer articles using the chunk attribute on your map. This issue usually crops up if you're using the specialized topic types (task, concept) and you're trying to combine information.">DITA: Combining topics</a> for details.</li>
<li class="li">Use a <code>concept</code> type topic and use regular <code>ol</code> and
              <code>li</code> list formatting rather than using steps. If your lists are light
              and short, the traditional list formatting might work just fine.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong class="ph b">Concept limitations</strong>. For concepts, you can have an unlimited number of <code>section</code> elements per topic.
          However, you can't include nested sections (third-level headings). If you need a
          nested section, here are your options:</p>
<ul class="ul" id="topic_tkf_1dq_bq__ul_r25_rpj_s4">
<li class="li">Nest <code>concept</code> elements inside each other.</li>
<li class="li">Create separate concept files and combine them through a map.</li>
<li class="li">Add an <code>outputclass</code> attribute to a <code>p</code> element (and
              select an output class that you will style in your webhelp stylesheet to look like a
              heading level 3),</li>
