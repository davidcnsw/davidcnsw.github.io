<div class="body conbody">
<p>The emphasis here is on quick explanations showing code samples, as well as tips and
   recommendations for working with various elements. </p>
<p>Although they started out as personal notes, I'm making these notes public and enabling comment
   controls because I hope to benefit from the expertise and insights of others. I plan to continue
   adding to these notes regularly, growing my understanding and helping others understand DITA in a
   quick and easy way too.</p>
