description: "The <code>shortdesc</code> element allows you to add a summary overview of the topic
in a couple of sentences right below the topic <code>title</code> and before the
<code>conbody</code> or <code>taskbody</code> element."

<div class="body conbody">
<div class="p">The <code>shortdesc</code> element is more important than it initially appears to be.
      Although optional, it's highly recommended that you use this tag. The
        <code>shortdesc</code> appears in several key places:
<ul class="ul" id="concept_vzv_dx5_r4__ul_txg_hx5_r4">
<li class="li">As a tooltip in links pointing to the page</li>
<li class="li">As a description on a parent page containing child pages</li>
<li class="li">As the summary that appears in search results</li>
<li class="li">Possibly as context sensitive help (perhaps pulled as a tooltip to show in an interface
          with a link to learn more)</li>
</ul>
<p> Here's an
      example:
{% highlight xml %}<concept id="concept">
 <title>Wheel truing overview</title>
 <shortdesc>Truing your wheels requires you to tighten or loosen spokes with a spoke wrentch in a balanced pattern in order to change the shape of the wheel.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
   <p>Blah blah blah...</p>
 </conbody>
</concept>{% endhighlight %}
</p></div>
</p></div>
