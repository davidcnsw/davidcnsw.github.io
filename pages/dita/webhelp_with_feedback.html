<h1 class="title topictitle1">DITA: Webhelp with Feedback</h1>
<div class="body conbody">
<p>Because documentation on this feature is so scant in Oxygen, I'm elaborating with a bit of
      detail here.</p>
<p class="p toc">
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Setting Up the Feedback System</h2>
<p>To set up this commenting system, first create a mysql database and add a user to the database
        with all privileges. This process is similar for a lot of different sites (e.g., WordPress,
        Drupal, Joomla), so don't assume this is anything special or difficult. Exactly how you
        create a mysql database and user depends a bit on your web host. </p>
<p>The instructions in Oxygen focus on using Xampp to set up this database, and they include a
        specific mysql statement (<code>INSERT INTO `mysql`.`user` ...</code>) to pass in
        phpmyadmin. You can ignore Oxygen's instructions, as they're poorly written and somewhat
        misleading. Xampp is for local environments (i.e., a web server emulated on your local
        computer, not on an actual server on the web). You would only use Xampp for testing
        purposes, not for actual deployment. The long mysql statement in Oxygen's help is
        unnecessary if you simply grant the user all privileges to the database (a common
        configuration). </p>
<div class="p">If you're like most tech writers, you don't have direct access to the servers where you
        deploy your help content. (That's actually good, because then you don't have to maintain
        them.) Request from your server admin the following:
<ul class="ul" id="concept_ssh_15r_x4__ul_elr_gz1_y4">
<li class="li">A server with Apache, MySQL, PHP >=5.16, and PHP MySQL Support. (This is a standard
            server deployment referred to as a LAMP stack, for linux, apache, mysql, and php.)</li>
<li class="li">Create a new MySQL database and add a user to it with all privileges. Ask for the
            database name, username, and password.</li>
</ul>
</div></div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Selecting an identifier</h2>
<p>When you transform the webhelp with feedback, you're prompted to use a documentation
        product ID. Think of your webhelp output as a "product." If you have 3 different webhelp
        outputs, you have 3 different products, each with their own unique product ID that you
        specify. Always the same product ID for the same output. This identifier is included in a
        configuration file so that comments are tied to a particular output. If you're publishing
        the webhelp files into different directories, consider using the directory name as the
        product ID.</p>
<p>When you run the configuration to install webhelp with feedback, there's one option that's
        a bit confusing: ""Display comments from other products. If checked, on this product pages
        will be visible also comments from other specified products!"</p>
<p>Understanding your webhelp outputs as "products" helps clarify this option. This means if
        you have two different products, and both have a file name and path such as
        topics/widgets.dita, then comments made on one instance of topics/widgets.dita will appear
        on other instances of the the file topics/widgets.dita in other products. </p>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Installing it the first time</h2>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<p>The first time you deploy webhelp with feedback, after you FTP the content to your server,
        go to the /install directory and walk through the installation. You'll be prompted for the
        database name, database username, password, as well as other configuration options. You can
        change some of the options later. The installation creates a config.php file in
          <span class="ph filepath">oxygen-webhelp/resources/php/config/config.php </span>where all your
        configuration options are stored.</p>
<p>The first time you install Webhelp with Feedback, select the check box to create a new
        database structure. However, on subsequent deployments of other help files, do not select
        the database structure check box. If you do, your previous database tables will be
        erased/dropped and your comments removed.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Publishing subsequent revisions</h2>
<p>When you publish subsequent iterations of your webhelp, don't upload the /install folder in
    the output. You only need to upload the install folder first time when you create the
    installation. On subsequent uploads, just upload the other output files. </p>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Logging in as administrator</h2>
<p>When you install Webhelp with Feedback the first time, you're prompted to create an
        administrator. For subsequent product deployments, you're not prompted to create an
        administrator account.</p>
<p>Regardless, by default there's a user created named "administrator" that uses the
        administrator's email address you set up in the configuration. If you forget the admin
        account, to retrieve the password for the administrator, try logging in to the Admin panel
        (in the comments area) and choose to reset your password. Once you reset the password and
        can log in successfully, you can update the password.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Managing comments</h2>
<p>Go to a topic in your help, log in as an administrator, and you'll see an Admin button. This
        takes you to the Admin interface, which is actually shown inside a topic rather than as a
        separate interface apart from the help system. There you can manage comments and control
        user roles.</p>
<p>There are three types of notification options: reply notification, page notification, and
    webhelp notification. The reply notification sends a notification when someone makes a reply to
    your comment. The page notification sends a notification if someone else adds a comment on the
    same page. The webhelp notification sends a notification if anyone makes a comment on any page
    in the webhelp.</p>
<p>There isn't a way to surface an RSS feed or show the latest comments.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Adding Administrators</h2>
<p>To enable more administrators, ask a person to create an account. The user will appear in the
        Admin interface (which you access by clicking the Admin button in the comments area). You
        can click the user's name and change his or her role and notification options.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Modifying file names versus topic IDs</h2>
<p>You can change topic IDs without losing comment history, but you can't change the file
        names and paths. The file name and path is what connects a topic with the comments
        associated with it. You can continue to publish updates to the help. If the new topics have
        the same file name the previous comments remain associated with the new topic. But if you
        change the file name or path, the comment history for the topic is lost.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Versions</h2>
<p>Each time you transform your output, you're prompted to select a version. In the Admin view
        of the output, you can specify a point in time for comments to appear. For example, you can
        specify that only comments after version 2.0 can appear. You do this by clicking the
          <span class="ph uicontrol">Set Version</span> button. Then select the starting version from which
        comments are visible (meaning visible from that version forward).</p>
