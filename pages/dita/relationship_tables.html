arrange topics in a relationship table, you end up with a list of related links at the end of
each topic."

<div class="body conbody">
<p>A relationship table is an actual table grid that defines the way topics link to each other.
      You add links to topics in the table's rows and columns. Topics in the same row link to each
      other. When you output your help, if some of the topics aren't included in the output, they
      are intelligently not included in the relationship table, so your links don't break.</p>
<p>There are quite a few options for how you can define the linking relationships, but here's
      the easiest way to implement relationship tables. </p>
<p class="p toc">
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Wait until the end to create the links</h2>
<p>First, wait until you're mostly done with your help content before you start creating link
        relationships. You may be changing link names as you write and organize files, and it
        doesn't make sense to try to establish linking relationships to content that is still in
        constant flux.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Link related topics through your topicheads directly</h2>
<div class="p">In your map file, for each <code>topichead</code> area (which groups topics together),
      add the<code> collection-type</code> attribute with a value of <code>family</code>,
      like
      this:
{% highlight xml %}<topichead navtitle="Links" collection-type="family">
 <topicref href="keyref_links.dita"/>
 <topicref href="inline_links.dita"/>
 <topicref href="related_links.dita"/>
 <topicref href="relationship_tables.dita"/>
 </topichead>{% endhighlight %}
</div>
<p>All of the topics in this group will link to each other via related links at the bottom (just
        like with relationship tables). You don't have to actually create a relationship table at
        all with this method. In almost all cases, you want to link these groups of files to each
        other. </p>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Linking topics that appear in different groups</h2>
<div class="p">For topics that should link across groups, you need to create a relationship table grid in
        your map file and establish which topics you want linked to each other. Here's the key thing
        to remember with relationship tables:
<ul class="ul" id="concept_wl4_ssl_q4__ul_sbs_zj5_q4">
<li class="li">Topics in the same row link to each other. </li>
<li class="li">Topics in the same cell do not link to each other.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Here's an example:</p>
{% highlight xml %}
      <reltable>
      <relheader>
   <relcolspec type="concept">
   <relcolspec type="task">
   <relcolspec type="reference">
      </relheader>
     
      <relrow>
        <relcell>
          <topicref href="sample_concept.dita"/>
        </relcell>
      
        <relcell>
          <topicref href="task_example1.dita"/>
          <topicref href="task_example2.dita"/>
        </relcell>

        <relcell>
          <topicref href="referencefile.dita"/>
         </relcell>
      </relrow>
    </reltable>
   {% endhighlight %}
<p>It may make more sense to actually show the table in its display form: </p>
<div class="tablenoborder">
<table cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="" id="table_ryr_xwv_x4" class="table" frame="border" border="1" rules="all">
<thead class="thead" align="left">
<tr class="row">
<th class="entry" valign="top" id="d9296e100">Concept</th>
<th class="entry" valign="top" id="d9296e103">Task</th>
<th class="entry" valign="top" id="d9296e106">Reference</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody class="tbody">
<tr class="row">
<td class="entry" valign="top" headers="d9296e100 ">sample_concept.dita</td>
<td class="entry" valign="top" headers="d9296e103 ">
<p>task_example1.dita </p>
<p>task_example2.dita</p>
</td>
<td class="entry" valign="top" headers="d9296e106 ">referencefile.dita</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>In this relationship table, sample_concept.dita will have links to task_example1.dita,
        task_example2.dita, and referencefile.dita because they're in the same row. </p>
<p>However, task_example1.dita and task_example2.dita will not have links to each other
        because they're in the same cell.</p>
<p>If you want topics in the same cell to link to each other, add the attribute
          <code>collection-type="family"</code> to the <code>relcell</code> element that
        contains the topics you want to link to each other.</p>
{{note}}It's a lot easier to see the rows and cells when you're in the Author view.{{end}}
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Linking to external resources</h2>
<p>Now let's say some topics link to some external files on the web. For example, suppose you
        want the inline_links.dita topic to link to a topic called http://example.org. You could
        manage these external resource links in the relationship table, but it's easier to manage
        them in a <code>related links</code> section of the topic itself. The related links will
        be combined with the relationship table links at runtime.</p>
<div class="p">To add the <code>related-links</code> element in a topic, add it after the
          <code>conbody</code>, <code>taskbody</code>, or <code>refbody</code>
        element:
{% highlight xml %} <related-links>
  <link href="http://example.org">Example.org</link>
 </related-links>{% endhighlight %}
</div>
<p>This kind of link is useful as a list of relevant resources about the topic. You don't need
        to manage these links in the relationship table because, as a web resource, you don't need
        to worry about the topic not being available in the output.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Column headers</h2>
<div class="p">If you want the links to be grouped into different related link sections, such as "Related
        concepts," "Related tasks," and "Related information," add a <code>type</code> attribute
        to the <code>relcolspec</code> element, like this:</p>
{% highlight xml %}<relcolspec type="concept"/>
<relcolspec type="task"/>
<relcolspec type="reference"/> {% endhighlight %}
</div>
<p>However, I don't think it's wise to separate related links into these different topic
        types, since many times readers don't clearly distinguish topic types frome ach other, and
        sometimes concepts are somewhat task-like anyway. If your concepts have lite list formatting
        in them (using the ol element), the distinction between tasks and concepts may be more
        fuzzy.</p>
<p>In fact, if you remove the column names, there isn't much reason to separate out the topics
        into separate columns. You could instead just group all the topics you want to relate to
        each other in the same cell and add <code>collection-type="family"</code> for that
        cell.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Working with relationship tables</h2>
<p>Probably the easiest way to work with relationship tables in Oxygen is to insert the
        relationship table code into the bottom of your map file in the Text view (or make sure your
        cursor is in a valid place in the map file and click the Insert Relationship Table button in
        the Author view). Then switch to the Author view. </p>
<p>Right-click the map file header tab and select Open in DITA Maps Manager View. Drag the
        topics from the maps manager view into the cells you want. Remember, if you've already added
          <code>collection-type="family"</code> to the groups in your map, then you only need to
        relate those topics that fall outside of the existing groups. </p>
