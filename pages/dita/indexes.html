<p> There are various approaches for adding indexes, but here's a typical way to add index
      entries. </p>
<div class="p">In the <code>prolog | metadata | keywords</code> element of a topic, add index terms The
        <code>prolog</code> element comes just after the <code>shortdesc</code> element
      (which follows the title). Here's a
      sample:
{% highlight xml %}<title>My Title</title>
 <shortdesc/>
<prolog>
    <metadata>
      <keywords>
        <indexterm>cars</indexterm>
      </keywords>
    </metadata>
  </prolog>{% endhighlight %}
</div>
<div class="p">You can also nest index entries inside of each other to create parent-child relationships among
   the index
   terms:
{% highlight xml %}  <prolog>
    <metadata>
      <keywords>
        <indexterm>cars
                <indexterm>sedan</indexterm>
        </indexterm>
      </keywords>
    </metadata>
  </prolog>{% endhighlight %}
</div>
<div class="p">The result in the index will look like this:
{% highlight xml %}cars
  - sedan{% endhighlight %}
</div>
<p>When you want to create a "see" entry for an index, code it like this:</p>
{% highlight xml %}
   <indexterm>vehicle
   <index-see>car</index-see>
</indexentry>
  {% endhighlight %}
<p>The result of the index-see element is the following:</p>
{% highlight xml %}
    vehicle, see car
   {% endhighlight %}
<p>If you want to include a page number with the see also reference, write it like this:</p>
{% highlight xml %}
    <indexterm>vehicle
   <index-see-also>car</index-see-also>
</indexentry>
    </indexterm>
  {% endhighlight %}
<p>The output will look like this:</p>
{% highlight xml %}
    vehicle ..... 23
           see also car
   {% endhighlight %}
<p>Keep in mind that index entries added to the <code>prolog</code> section will include page
      numbers pointing to the location of the <code>prolog</code>. Since most topics are short,
      this isn't a problem. Also, since the online help is usually the main deliverable, it's also
      not a problem. However, you can also add index entries in the middle of your topics. (But
      apparently this causes some problems, especially with translation.)</p>
<p>Also, some PDF renderers don't include page numbers to index entries. At any rate, since PDF
      isn't usually the main deliverable, this is not a concern with index terms.</p>
