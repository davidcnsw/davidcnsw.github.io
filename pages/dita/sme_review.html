<div class="body conbody">
<p class="shortdesc">To handle SME review of content, you have a number of options. However, the most
  efficient review process allows for the following:</p>
<div class="p">
<ul class="ul" id="concept_yb3_slc_s4__ul_elh_jyv_x4">
<li class="li">The ability to iterate on the content during review (based on incoming feedback) so you can
     update topics before other reviewers begin their review. </li>
<li class="li">The ability for reviewers to interface with each other via comments.</li>
<li class="li">Historical comments so other reviewers can see the evolution of the content.</li>
<li class="li">Presentation of the content in the same form that users will view it in (rather than a
     rendered PDF or Word document).</li>
<li class="li">The ability for reviewers to review the content asynchronously on their own schedules and
     times. </li>
<li class="li">The ability for reviewers to see the updates you've already made to the content so they know
     their recommendations don't fall on deaf ears.</li>
<li class="li">The ability for reviewers to continue their review post-release since people are usually
     busy up until release time.</li>
</ul></div>
<p>Based on this criteria, probably the best way to review DITA content is through Oxygen's
   Webhelp with Feedback output. This provides a comment section at the bottom of topics that allows
   people to comment on the topic, read others' comments, allows authors to reply to comments,
   allows for notifications that stimulate conversation, and more.</p>
<p>For details on creating the webhelp with feedack theme, see <a class="xref" href="/webhelp_with_feedback" title="You can enable commenting below your webhelp topics by selecting the Webhelp with Feedback skin.">DITA: Webhelp with Feedback</a>.</p>
