<div class="body">
<p>When you initiate a bunch of transformations in OxygenXML, each time Java processes the
      transform, your mouse loses focus as you see the Java icon appear in your toolbar to start the
      build and then disappear when it's finished building (at least on a Mac). This can be
      extremely annoying, especially if you have more than 5 or 6 transforms. You end up just
      sitting there waiting until you have control with your computer again.</p>
<p>Fortunately, you can stop Java from taking away your mouse's focus. For DITA-OT/ANT
      transforms:</p>
<ol class="ol">
<li class="li">Edit the transformation scenario (or go to <span class="ph menucascade"><span class="ph uicontrol">Document</span> > <span class="ph uicontrol">Document Transformation</span> > <span class="ph uicontrol">Configure Transformation Scenario(s)</span> > <span class="ph uicontrol">Edit</span></span>).</li>
<li class="li">Click the <span class="ph uicontrol">Advanced</span> tab.</li>
<li class="li">In the JVM arguments field, for Macs, add a space after the first parameter, and then
          <code>-Dapple.awt.UIElement=true</code>. For PCs, add
          <code>-Djava.awt.headless=true</code>.</li>
