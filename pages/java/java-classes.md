## Quick summary

* a class is a template used for creating objects
* must be initialized with an object to use
* can be initialized with arguments
* uses Upperclass camel case
* class name must match file name
* you can only have 1 *public* class per Java file, but you can have multiple non-public classes in the same file
* contains fields (primitives or object references) and methods

## Eclipse example

* object_example

## Example

```java
public class Dog{

String breed;

int age;
int size;

String color;

void bark(){   }

void hungry(){   }

void sleeping(){   }

}

public static void main (String[] args) {

Dog d = new Dog(); // make a new object
d.bark(); // call the bark method on my object
d.size = 40; // set the size for the object
}
```

Here's another example:

```java
class Song {

void setArtist(String name) {
}

void setTitle(String song) {
}
}

public static void main (String[] args) {

Song t2 = new Song();
t2.setArtist("Travis");
t2.setTitle("Sing");
Song s3 = new Song();
s3.setArtist("Sex Pistols");
s3.setTitle("My Way");

}
```

Here's an example that initializes with an argument:

```java
public class Puppy
{   public Puppy(String name)
{      // This constructor has one parameter, name.

System.out.println("Passed Name is :" + name );
}
```

```
public static void main(String []args)

{      // Following statement would create an object myPuppy

Puppy myPuppy = new Puppy( "tommy" );   }

}
```

This bicycle example comes from [Oracle's Java tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/class.html).

```java
class Bicycle {

int cadence = 0;
int speed = 0;
int gear = 1;

void changeCadence(int newValue) {
cadence = newValue;
}

void changeGear(int newValue) {
gear = newValue;
}

void speedUp(int increment) {
speed = speed + increment;
}

void applyBrakes(int decrement) {
speed = speed - decrement;
}

void printStates() {
System.out.println("cadence:" +
cadence + " speed:" +
speed + " gear:" + gear);
}
}
```

And here's the instance:

```java
class BicycleDemo {
public static void main(String[] args) {

// Create two different
// Bicycle objects
Bicycle bike1 = new Bicycle();
Bicycle bike2 = new Bicycle();

// Invoke methods on
// those objects
bike1.changeCadence(50);
bike1.speedUp(10);
bike1.changeGear(2);
bike1.printStates();

bike2.changeCadence(50);
bike2.speedUp(10);
bike2.changeGear(2);
bike2.changeCadence(40);
bike2.speedUp(10);
bike2.changeGear(3);
bike2.printStates();
}
}
```

## Static classes

If a class is static, it means you don't have to create an instance of the class.

> On a class, the static keyword means that only one instance of that class exists. You can't create a new instance of a static class
>  -- Java 7 for Absolute Beginners

## "Instantiating a class"

Instantiating a class is the same as creating an object from the class; also referred to as initializing a new object. You create an "instance" of the class.

All objects of a class have access to the methods and fields of that class.

## How you create a new object

Constructors create the objects. The `new` keyword is the default constructor for classes. (You can use "construct" instead of "create").

You use a constructor to construct the object from the class (template). The most common constructor is the `new` keyword, but there are other ways to instantiate a class as well.

You could also create an object reference without assigning any value to it. You might see something like this:

```java
Point originOne;
```

In this case, `Point` is the class and `originOne` is a reference variable to the class. But until you invoke the `new` keyword, you haven't actually created a new object here.

## Fields

The variables declared inside a class are referred to generically as fields. However, you can be more specific with the terminology:

* local variables: fields inside a method or constructor
* instance variables: variables inside the class but not in any method. (They only become alive when you instantiate the class.)
* class variables: variables within a class but with the static keywords

## Questions to ask about a class

* Is it public or private? 
* What fields and methods does the class have? 
* Does the class inherit another class? 
* What does the class do? 
* What does the class return? 
* How is the class instantiated?

## Fields

A field can be an object reference:

```java
Address address;
```
Here `address` is the object that refers to the class `Address`. We haven't instantiated the class yet until we invoke the class's constructor. Here we just define the object reference. The class isn't actually initialized.

## Abstract versus concrete

Classes are by default concrete. If they're abstract, you can't instantiate them. Instead, you must extend them to create a subclass from them.
