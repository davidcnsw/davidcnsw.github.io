<p>When you start writing advanced JavaScript code that contains a lot of complex information, you need a way to simplify and manipulate the information.Â JavaScript uses variables to simplify the statements and work with information. The variables act as containers to hold values.</p>
<p>You list the variables before the statements, like this:</p>
<p>{% highlight javascript %}var area = 4000;
var size = 200;{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>In this case, <code>area</code> is a variable, and its value is assigned to be <code>4000</code>. <code>size</code> is also a variable, with a value of <code>200</code>.</p>
<p>You can also list multiple variables by separating the variables with commas on the same line, like this:</p>
<p>{% highlight javascript %}var area = 4000, size = 200, distance = 100;{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>Variables must be one word and can contain both letters and numbers (but can't start with numbers).</p>
<p>If the variable stores text (such as a phrase), the text is called a string. Strings are enclosed in quotes.</p>
<p>{% highlight javascript %}var welcome = "Welcome to the application.";{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>Single quotes are also acceptable instead of double quotes, but you must be consistent. You can't start with a double quote and end with a single quote.</p>
