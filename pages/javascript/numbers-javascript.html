<p>When you're working with numbers, it's important to understand addition versus concatenation. Addition gives you the sum of two numbers, whereas concatenation just joins or "sandwiches" the two values together.</p>
<p>For example, here's addition:</p>
<p>{% highlight javascript %}var x = 10;
var y = 5;
console.log (x + y){% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>The result would be 15.</p>
<p>However, if one of the values is a string rather than a regular number, the result will be concatenated instead of added. A string is identified by quotations; numbers do not have quotations.</p>
<p>{% highlight javascript %}var x = "10";
var y = 5;
console.log (x + y){% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>The result would be 105. The two values get joined together.</p>
<h2>Not a Number (NaN)</h2>
<p>If you try to multiply a string by a number, the result will be <code>NaN</code>, which means "Not a Number."</p>
<p>You would see <code>NaN</code> if you tried to run something like this:</p>
<p>{% highlight javascript %}var x = "Touchdown!";
var y = 5;
console.log (x * y);{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>The result would be NaN, because 5 times a touchdown doesn't yield a number.</p>
<h2>The Math Object</h2>
<p>JavaScript has a built-in Math object that you can use to do various things with numbers. For example,</p>
<p>{% highlight javascript %}var x = 5.8;
//round the value of x
var y = Math.round(x);{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>This will round the value of the x variable, resulting in 6.</p>
<p>Other methods you can apply to the Math object include <code>.max</code>, <code>.min</code>, <code>.random</code>.</p>
