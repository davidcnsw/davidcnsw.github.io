## Overall page views

Here's a breakdown of site traffic analytics on idratherbewriting.com from Jan 1, 2019 through Dec 31, 2019, according to Google Analytics. The blue line represents 2019, while the brown line represents 2014 for comparison.

The above screenshot compares the traffic of the site in 2019 with the traffic 5 years earlier. In 2014, the total page view count for the year was 588,826. The site's traffic has grown by 335% over 5 years.

{{site.data.alerts.note}}A "page view" is when the page loads, regardless of whether it's the same visitor or a different visitor. A "session" refers to a <i>unique visit</i> to the site. If the same visitor views 10 pages, it only counts as a single session. The average number of page views per session is 1.65.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Analytics breakdown

The following table includes more details from other Google Analytics reports. To make the data more meaningful, I've provided both the 2018 and 2019 data so you can compare the changes from one year to the next. I also round data to the nearest whole number (e.g., 1.51% is rounded to 2%; 1.49% is rounded to 1%).

All of this information is provided through Google Analytics by default. (I don't have any special scripts or other tracking cookies other than what Google adds through Google Analytics. Also note that I'm not sure how Google tracks age and gender. Google also tracks hobby categories, though I haven't shown it here.)

## API doc traffic percentage

In 2018, 59% of my site traffic came to my API documentation site ([/learnapidoc/](/learnapidoc/). In 2019, that percentage jumped up to 72%

<figure><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/learnapidoc_traffic3.png" alt="API documentation traffic" /> <figcaption>The traffic to my <a href='/learnapidoc/'>API documentation site</a> accounted for about 72% of the overall site traffic.</figcaption></figure>

Here's a graph that compares this growth to the previous period:

<figure><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/learnapidocpreviousperiod.png" alt="API documentation traffic in 2019 compared to traffic in 2018" /> <figcaption>API documentation traffic in 2019 compared to traffic in 2018</figcaption></figure>

The traffic from the API documentation visitors is outperforming other traffic sources. My most popular page is [Swagger UI tutorial](/learnapidoc/pubapis_swagger.html) (8.24% of total traffic), followed by [Parameters](/learnapidoc/docapis_doc_parameters.html) (8.18%),  [OpenAPI tutorial](/learnapidoc/pubapis_openapi_tutorial_overview.html) (2.41%), [Postman](/learnapidoc/docapis_postman.html) (2.27%), and [Access and print JSON](/learnapidoc/docapis_access_json_values.html) (2.05%). The remaining pages are all under 2% of total traffic.

## Quality of impressions

The quality of impressions depends on the influence of the site. Impressions from a highly influential site carry more weight than impressions from a less influential site. In earlier years, several companies ranked the most influential bloggers in tech comm. Their categories shifted more broadly and eventually people stopped creating these influencer lists. Links to previous rankings are below.
