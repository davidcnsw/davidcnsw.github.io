I'd Rather Be Writing (idratherbewriting.com) is one of the most popular sites where technical writers and engineers go to stay updated with the latest technical writing news, trends, and information in the industry, especially concerning <a href='/learnapidoc/'>API documentation</a>. Because of this, I can help increase your product or service's visibility more than any other technical writing site online.

## Ad space options and costs

<img style="float:right; padding-left:15px;" src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/comics/yourcomichere.png" alt="advertising on I'd Rather Be Writing"/>

I mainly help increase visibility of your product primarily through **ad impressions**. An impression occurs when someone loads a page where your ad is visible. In 2019, idratherbewriting.com had 1,974,524 page views, or about 5,409 page views a day (225 an hour). More specifically, users created 1,207,264 sessions, with 1.64 pages per session and an average of 1:41 minutes per session.

{{site.data.alerts.note}} For details about how many page views, sessions, and other analytics information, see the <a href="/analytics">2019 site traffic and analytics</a>.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

You can advertise your product or service on idratherbewriting.com. Different ad spaces are more visible than others. You can select from several different spaces or services. The availability and cost for each ad space is as follows:

<table>
<colgroup>
   <col width="30%" />
   <col width="20%" />
   <col width="40%" />
</colgroup>
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Ad space</th>
        <th>Size</th>
        <th>Cost per year</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>

    </tbody>
</table>

For billing, I usually send you an invoice through Paypal. Billing is done prior to any advertising efforts. Although the transaction is through PayPal, you can use either your credit card or PayPal account to submit payment. You can also mail me a check if you prefer.

## Sidebar ad space {#sidebarad}

Sidebar ads (250px x 150px) appear in the left sidebar and randomly rotate positions each time the page refreshes &mdash; this helps refocus the reader's attention on the ads. There is no specific hierarchy to ads in the sidebar.

Your ad can be any image type (JPG, GIF, PNG, or SVG) and color; the dimensions must be 250 x 150px pixels in size. Slow-looping animated GIFs are allowed, but not Flash. You can switch the ad at any time by sending me a new graphic.

<figure>
<img style="border:1px solid #dedede;" title="Sidebar ads" src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/ads_sidebar.png" alt="sidebar ads" max-width="340"/><figcaption>Sidebar ads appear in the sidebar in a dual column. They rotate randomly with each page refresh.</figcaption></figure>

The cost for sidebar ads is $1,000 per year. For 6 months only, the cost is $600.

## Horizontal Inline Ad Space {#horizontalinlinead}

The Horizontal Inline space (728 x 90px) appears below each post, right above the comments, in the single post view. This highly visible space is inline with the reader's eye and provides a natural click-point after a reader finishes reading a post.

<figure><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/horizontal_inline_ad-550x331.png" alt="horizontal_inline_ad" max-width="550" /> <figcaption>Horizontal Inline ads appear at the bottom of each post</figcaption></figure>

Horizontal Inline ads can be JPG, GIF, PNG, or SVG. Animated GIF is also allowed. Like the sidebar, the position of the horizontal inline ads rotate randomly with each page refresh. There is no limit to the number of horizontal inline post ads that can appear below the post (currently there are 4). The cost for inline horizontal ads is $2,000 per year.

## Top Banner Ad Space {#topComic}

The top banner ad space (400 x 60px) refers to the top section of the site, in the upper-right corner. The top banner ad is placed in one of the most visually dominant places on the site.

<figure><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/top_banner-600x292.png" alt="Top Banner Ad Space" max-width="600" /> <figcaption>The Top Banner ad space, which appears at the top of the site, catches the eye of most readers.</figcaption></figure>

Top banner ads can be JPG, GIF, PNG, or SVG. Animated GIFs aren't allowed. There is only one ad in the Top Banner ad space per advertiser, but it can rotate depending on the number of ads you want to put in this space. For example, if you have three top banner ads, the ads can rotate in this space with each page refresh. The cost for top banner ad space is $4,000 per year. Only one advertiser can rent this space. It's like the main billboard for my site.

## Newsletter Space {#newsletterspace}

I send out 4 newsletters a month (one per week) to all my email subscribers (5,400 + readers). These newsletters contain links and excerpts to the latest posts (usually two articles per newsletter). Each blog post in the newsletter typically gets around 300 clicks, and the advertising graphic receives approximately 60 clicks or more. The size of the newsletter graphic is 600 x 70px graphic. Here's an [example](https://tinyletter.com/tomjoht/letters/new-posts-on-i-d-rather-be-writing-59):

<figure><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/newsletterspace.png" alt="Newsletter space ad" style="max-width: 600px"><figcaption>The newsletter ad space has some of the most visibility and reach, especially for regular readers. You can see the <a href='https://tinyletter.com/tomjoht/archive'>newsletter archive here</a>.</figcaption></figure>

The image format can be any standard image format (JPG, PNG, GIF), but not animated (because the ads appear in email). The cost for advertising in the newsletter space is $1,500 per year. Shorter advertising durations aren't allowed.

## Inline text blurbs (API doc site only) {#inline_text_blurbs}

Inline text blurbs are short snippets of text, about 1-3 sentences in length (or 140 characters), that appear in random positions on every page of my [API documentation site](/learnapidoc/). You can define 10 ad blurbs with the variety of content and links you want. Here's an example:

{% include random_ad.html %}

The text blurb's text changes randomly with each page refresh. However, the position of the blurb on the page remains in the same (initially random) location.

The in-text ads are denoted with a Bootstrap alert-type formatting, with text that says “Sponsored message” prefacing the ad. Pages not included are contact, search, error, or other non-content pages. A maximum of 3 inline blurbs (from different advertisers) can appear on each page. Cost for inline text blurbs to appear on the API doc site is $3,000 per year.

## Product review posts {#product_review_posts}

I also offer product review posts to help with visibility. To write this post, I usually have a 20-30 minute phone call with you to find out what message you want to share. Here are some sample product reviews I wrote previously:

* [XML Documentation for Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) — Integrating documentation and marketing content into a seamless whole](https://idratherbewriting.com/2019/03/10/introducing-xml-documentation-for-adobe-experience-manager/) (668 page views as of 3-25-19)
* [MadCap Central -- a first look at MadCap’s new cloud-based collaboration and publishing solution](https://idratherbewriting.com/2017/01/16/madcap-central-review/) (1,968 page views as of 3-10-19)
* [The Story of Paligo: A new browser-based CCMS with all the features you'd ever want](https://idratherbewriting.com/2016/08/01/paligo-the-story-xml-ccms-in-the-cloud/) (5,533 page views as of 3-10-19)
* [Simplified Technical English and HyperSTE](https://idratherbewriting.com/2017/01/25/hyperste-simplified-technical-english-asd-ste100/) (4,056 page views as of 3-10-19)
* [Evaluating Adobe FrameMaker's responsive HTML5 output](https://idratherbewriting.com/2017/01/16/adobe-framemaker-html5-mobile-responsive-view/) (1,164 page views as of 3-10-19)
* [Adobe FrameMaker 2017 -- time, tools, and the tech writer’s focus on content](https://idratherbewriting.com/2017/03/06/adobe-framemaker-2017-doc-time-and-tools/) (2,042 page views as of 3-10-19)
* [Xeditor, a CMS editor for XML content](https://idratherbewriting.com/2016/03/30/xeditor-xml-editor-for-your-cms-or-ccms/) (1,335 page views as of 3-10-19)

Product review posts are typically 800-1,000 words long and ideally focus on features in a new release. (Having something newsworthy to write about helps establish the article's relevance.)

These review posts aren't merely marketing material converted into a blog post. I try to put a personal spin on posts to connect with my audience. A product review post typically takes 3-4 hours to write.

If possible, I'll download and explore your product before writing about it. But I don't have unlimited time to ramp up to an expert level on your product. I try to draw upon my industry insight and perspective to make insightful points. You'll also probably supply me with the information and messages you want to communicate.

Each product review post costs $700 per post. I always review these posts with you and, when published, I identify them as being sponsored posts. If desired, you can also write the post.

Product review posts have good results with search results. If you search google for [Xeditor][google-xeditor], [HyperSTE][google-hyperste], [Paligo][google-paligo], or [Madcap Central][google-madcap-central], you'll see that my product review posts appear on the first page of search results. This is because my site has a high page rank and influence.

I also infuse the posts with SEO techniques when I write them. Almost no one else in the tech comm industry has as much online influence as I do with idratherbewriting.com. However, note that for per the [Link Schemes](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66356?hl=en) policy with Google, I'm required to add `rel=nofollow` to any links that appear to companies (and their products) when I'm being paid to write the post. This attribute reduces the Pagerank that flows from my site through the link, but it avoids potential penalties or other spam-point assignments in the search algorithm.

## Podcasts {#podcasts}

Podcasts are 30-minute audio conversations that are recorded and distributed as on-demand audio files. If you'd like your company or product to be featured in a podcast, this format can help listeners get a better sense of your personality and story. Podcasts might not have as many hits as online readers, but those who do listen to podcasts feel a stronger connection with the hosts and story than with written posts. You can see all podcasts on my site on the [Podcasts](/category-podcasts/) page. I have recorded more than 200 podcasts and have a reputation in the industry for this medium.

To prepare for podcasts, I send you about 10 questions focused on the product or service that you want highlighted. The podcast length is typically 20-30 minutes and syndicated out on iTunes, Stitcher, and other channels. The cost is $300 per podcast.
