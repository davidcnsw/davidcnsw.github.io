<p>If you're looking for your photo or image source files (jpg) on a Mac (such as after you've imported them from a camera or iPhone), here's how you find them.</p>
<p>Open iPhoto, select a photo, and then go to <strong>File > Reveal in Finder > Original File</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/find-photo-files-on-mac.png" alt="Find photo source files on a Mac" /></p>
<p>Once Finder opens to show the original location, press Command + "up arrow" a few times to move up the directory structure until you get to the folder containing all images.</p>
